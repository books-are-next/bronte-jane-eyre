CHAPTER XXVI
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.&nbsp; She was just
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with
a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
“Stop!” she cried in French.&nbsp; “Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
not taken one peep.”
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.&nbsp; “Jane!”
called a voice, and I hastened down.&nbsp; I was received at the foot of the
stairs by Mr. Rochester.
“Lingerer!” he said, “my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
so long!”
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
me “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire
of his eyes,” and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to
eat some breakfast, he rang the bell.&nbsp; One of his lately hired servants,
a footman, answered it.
“Is John getting the carriage ready?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Is the luggage brought down?”
“They are bringing it down, sir.”
“Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
there: return and tell me.”
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
footman soon returned.
“Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.”
“And the carriage?”
“The horses are harnessing.”
“We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment
we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
coachman in his seat.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Jane, are you ready?”
I rose.&nbsp; There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
hall as we passed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester’s face was to feel that not a
second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.&nbsp; I wonder what other
bridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
and flashing eyes.
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame.&nbsp; I wanted to see the
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
glance fierce and fell.&nbsp; I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
seemed breasting and resisting.
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
breath.&nbsp; “Am I cruel in my love?” he said.&nbsp; “Delay an instant: lean on
me, Jane.”
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising
calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning
sky beyond.&nbsp; I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I
have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst
the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy
head-stones.&nbsp; I noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round
to the back of the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by
the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony.&nbsp; By Mr. Rochester they
were not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face from which the
blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and
my cheeks and lips cold.&nbsp; When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked
gently with me up the path to the porch.
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.&nbsp; All was still: two
shadows only moved in a remote corner.&nbsp; My conjecture had been correct:
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
Our place was taken at the communion rails.&nbsp; Hearing a cautious step
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a gentleman,
evidently—was advancing up the chancel.&nbsp; The service began.&nbsp; The
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
Rochester, went on.
“I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth allow,
are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful.”
He paused, as the custom is.&nbsp; When is the pause after that sentence ever
broken by reply?&nbsp; Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.&nbsp; And the
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou have this
woman for thy wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—
“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
said, “Proceed.”
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
intonation.&nbsp; Presently Mr. Wood said—
“I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been
asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.”
“The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us.&nbsp; “I
am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to
this marriage exists.”
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.&nbsp; What a hot and strong
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
front at this moment!&nbsp; How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
beneath!
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.&nbsp; “What is the nature of the impediment?” he
asked.&nbsp; “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?”
“Hardly,” was the answer.&nbsp; “I have called it insuperable, and I speak
advisedly.”
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.&nbsp; He continued,
uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—
“It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.&nbsp; Mr.
Rochester has a wife now living.”
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.&nbsp; I
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.&nbsp; His whole face was
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.&nbsp; He disavowed
nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things.&nbsp; Without speaking,
without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he
only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
“Who are you?” he asked of the intruder.
“My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London.”
“And you would thrust on me a wife?”
“I would remind you of your lady’s existence, sir, which the law
recognises, if you do not.”
“Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her
place of abode.”
“Certainly.”&nbsp; Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:—
“‘I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in
the county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was
married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,
merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish
Town, Jamaica.&nbsp; The record of the marriage will be found in the register
of that church—a copy of it is now in my possession.&nbsp; Signed, Richard
Mason.’”
“That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.”
“She was living three months ago,” returned the lawyer.
“How do you know?”
“I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
scarcely controvert.”
“Produce him—or go to hell.”
“I will produce him first—he is on the spot.&nbsp; Mr. Mason, have the
goodness to step forward.”
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too,
a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.&nbsp; The second
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
pale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason
himself.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.&nbsp; His eye, as I have
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body—but
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!”&nbsp; Contempt fell cool on
Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
only asked—“What have you to say?”
An inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.
“The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.&nbsp; I again demand,
what have you to say?”
“Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a sacred
place.”&nbsp; Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you aware, sir,
whether or not this gentleman’s wife is still living?”
“Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”
“She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate
tones: “I saw her there last April.&nbsp; I am her brother.”
“At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman.&nbsp; “Impossible!&nbsp; I am an
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
Rochester at Thornfield Hall.”
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester’s lips, and he muttered—
“No, by God!&nbsp; I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under
that name.”&nbsp; He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
formed his resolve, and announced it—
“Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.&nbsp;
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.”&nbsp; The man
obeyed.
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly
word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
me, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last.&nbsp; I am little better
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
fire and deathless worm.&nbsp; Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
whom I was married lives!&nbsp; You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester
at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time
inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there
under watch and ward.&nbsp; Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard
half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress.&nbsp; I now inform you that she is
my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name; sister
of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and
white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear.&nbsp; Cheer up,
Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you.&nbsp; Bertha
Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through
three generations!&nbsp; Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a
drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were
silent on family secrets before.&nbsp; Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied
her parent in both points.&nbsp; I had a charming partner—pure, wise, modest:
you can fancy I was a happy man.&nbsp; I went through rich scenes!&nbsp; Oh! my
experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it!&nbsp; But I owe you no
further explanation.&nbsp; Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up
to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and my wife!&nbsp; You shall
see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether
or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with
something at least human.&nbsp; This girl,” he continued, looking at me,
“knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all
was fair and legal and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a
feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and
embruted partner!&nbsp; Come all of you—follow!”
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
after.&nbsp; At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it
will not be wanted to-day.”
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
greet us.
“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your
congratulations!&nbsp; Who wants them?&nbsp; Not I!—they are fifteen years too
late!”
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.&nbsp; We mounted the
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us
to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you
here.”
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
too, he opened.&nbsp; In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
chain.&nbsp; Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in
a saucepan.&nbsp; In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
ran backwards and forwards.&nbsp; What it was, whether beast or human being,
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
mane, hid its head and face.
“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; “How are you? and how is
your charge to-day?”
“We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling
mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ‘rageous.”
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the
clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”
“Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”
“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
gazed wildly at her visitors.&nbsp; I recognised well that purple face,—those
bloated features.&nbsp; Mrs. Poole advanced.
“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she has
no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”
“One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
mortal discretion to fathom her craft.”
“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.
“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.
“‘Ware!” cried Grace.&nbsp; The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.&nbsp;
Mr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his
throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.&nbsp; She
was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.&nbsp; He could have settled her
with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only
wrestle.&nbsp; At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and
he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound
her to a chair.&nbsp; The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells
and the most convulsive plunges.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester then turned to the
spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
“That is my wife,” said he.&nbsp; “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
hours!&nbsp; And this is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my
shoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her
just as a change after that fierce ragout.&nbsp; Wood and Briggs, look at the
difference!&nbsp; Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this
face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
ye shall be judged!&nbsp; Off with you now.&nbsp; I must shut up my prize.”
We all withdrew.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
further order to Grace Poole.&nbsp; The solicitor addressed me as he
descended the stair.
“You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
glad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason
returns to Madeira.”
“My uncle!&nbsp; What of him?&nbsp; Do you know him?”
“Mr. Mason does.&nbsp; Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
house for some years.&nbsp; When your uncle received your letter intimating
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,
who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to
Jamaica, happened to be with him.&nbsp; Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;
for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the
name of Rochester.&nbsp; Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may
suppose, revealed the real state of matters.&nbsp; Your uncle, I am sorry to
say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
ever rise.&nbsp; He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate
you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason
to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.&nbsp; He
referred him to me for assistance.&nbsp; I used all despatch, and am thankful
I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.&nbsp; Were I not morally
certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would
advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had
better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of
Mr. Eyre.&nbsp; Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.
“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.&nbsp; The
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
I had now withdrawn.&nbsp; The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep, not to mourn, I
was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off the wedding
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
thought, for the last time.&nbsp; I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.&nbsp; I
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.&nbsp; And now I
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved—followed up and down
where I was led or dragged—watched event rush on event, disclosure open
beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.
The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;
there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no
defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a
calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short
questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence
adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;
then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all
was over.
I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.&nbsp; And yet where was
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her
prospects?
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was a
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
desolate.&nbsp; A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.&nbsp; My hopes were all dead—struck
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
the land of Egypt.&nbsp; I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
never revive.&nbsp; I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
master’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
seek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from his breast.&nbsp;
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted—confidence
destroyed!&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
what I had thought him.&nbsp; I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not
say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone
from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived
well.&nbsp; When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I
doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield.&nbsp; Real affection, it seemed,
he could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was
balked; he would want me no more.&nbsp; I should fear even to cross his path
now: my view must be hateful to him.&nbsp; Oh, how blind had been my eyes!&nbsp;
How weak my conduct!
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.&nbsp;
Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down
in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote
mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I
had no strength.&nbsp; I lay faint, longing to be dead.&nbsp; One idea only still
throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered
prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as
something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express
them—
“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.&nbsp; The whole
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.&nbsp; That
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my
soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;
the floods overflowed me.”

      CHAPTER XXVI
      Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
      accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
      impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.&nbsp; She was just
      fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with
      a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
      “Stop!” she cried in French.&nbsp; “Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
      not taken one peep.”
      So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
      usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.&nbsp; “Jane!”
      called a voice, and I hastened down.&nbsp; I was received at the foot of the
      stairs by Mr. Rochester.
      “Lingerer!” he said, “my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
      so long!”
      He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
      me “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire
      of his eyes,” and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to
      eat some breakfast, he rang the bell.&nbsp; One of his lately hired servants,
      a footman, answered it.
      “Is John getting the carriage ready?”
      “Yes, sir.”
      “Is the luggage brought down?”
      “They are bringing it down, sir.”
      “Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
      there: return and tell me.”
      The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
      footman soon returned.
      “Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.”
      “And the carriage?”
      “The horses are harnessing.”
      “We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment
      we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
      coachman in his seat.”
      “Yes, sir.”
      “Jane, are you ready?”
      I rose.&nbsp; There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
      for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
      hall as we passed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
      held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
      follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester’s face was to feel that not a
      second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.&nbsp; I wonder what other
      bridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
      resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
      and flashing eyes.
      I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
      gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
      seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame.&nbsp; I wanted to see the
      invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
      glance fierce and fell.&nbsp; I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
      seemed breasting and resisting.
      At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
      breath.&nbsp; “Am I cruel in my love?” he said.&nbsp; “Delay an instant: lean on
      me, Jane.”
      And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising
      calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning
      sky beyond.&nbsp; I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I
      have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst
      the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy
      head-stones.&nbsp; I noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round
      to the back of the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by
      the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony.&nbsp; By Mr. Rochester they
      were not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face from which the
      blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and
      my cheeks and lips cold.&nbsp; When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked
      gently with me up the path to the porch.
      We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
      surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.&nbsp; All was still: two
      shadows only moved in a remote corner.&nbsp; My conjecture had been correct:
      the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
      of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
      old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
      of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
      wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
      Our place was taken at the communion rails.&nbsp; Hearing a cautious step
      behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a gentleman,
      evidently—was advancing up the chancel.&nbsp; The service began.&nbsp; The
      explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
      clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
      Rochester, went on.
      “I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
      judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
      either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
      together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
      so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth allow,
      are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful.”
      He paused, as the custom is.&nbsp; When is the pause after that sentence ever
      broken by reply?&nbsp; Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.&nbsp; And the
      clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
      breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
      towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou have this
      woman for thy wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—
      “The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”
      The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
      same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
      his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
      said, “Proceed.”
      Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
      intonation.&nbsp; Presently Mr. Wood said—
      “I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been
      asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.”
      “The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us.&nbsp; “I
      am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to
      this marriage exists.”
      Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
      no movement but to possess himself of my hand.&nbsp; What a hot and strong
      grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
      front at this moment!&nbsp; How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
      beneath!
      Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.&nbsp; “What is the nature of the impediment?” he
      asked.&nbsp; “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?”
      “Hardly,” was the answer.&nbsp; “I have called it insuperable, and I speak
      advisedly.”
      The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.&nbsp; He continued,
      uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—
      “It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.&nbsp; Mr.
      Rochester has a wife now living.”
      My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
      to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
      frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.&nbsp; I
      looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.&nbsp; His whole face was
      colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.&nbsp; He disavowed
      nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things.&nbsp; Without speaking,
      without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he
      only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
      “Who are you?” he asked of the intruder.
      “My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London.”
      “And you would thrust on me a wife?”
      “I would remind you of your lady’s existence, sir, which the law
      recognises, if you do not.”
      “Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her
      place of abode.”
      “Certainly.”&nbsp; Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
      out in a sort of official, nasal voice:—
      “‘I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
      fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in
      the county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was
      married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,
      merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish
      Town, Jamaica.&nbsp; The record of the marriage will be found in the register
      of that church—a copy of it is now in my possession.&nbsp; Signed, Richard
      Mason.’”
      “That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does
      not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.”
      “She was living three months ago,” returned the lawyer.
      “How do you know?”
      “I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
      scarcely controvert.”
      “Produce him—or go to hell.”
      “I will produce him first—he is on the spot.&nbsp; Mr. Mason, have the
      goodness to step forward.”
      Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too,
      a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
      spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.&nbsp; The second
      stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
      pale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason
      himself.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.&nbsp; His eye, as I have
      often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
      its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead
      received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
      lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
      church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body—but
      Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!”&nbsp; Contempt fell cool on
      Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
      only asked—“What have you to say?”
      An inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.
      “The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.&nbsp; I again demand,
      what have you to say?”
      “Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a sacred
      place.”&nbsp; Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you aware, sir,
      whether or not this gentleman’s wife is still living?”
      “Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”
      “She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate
      tones: “I saw her there last April.&nbsp; I am her brother.”
      “At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman.&nbsp; “Impossible!&nbsp; I am an
      old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
      Rochester at Thornfield Hall.”
      I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester’s lips, and he muttered—
      “No, by God!&nbsp; I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under
      that name.”&nbsp; He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
      formed his resolve, and announced it—
      “Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.&nbsp;
      Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
      clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.”&nbsp; The man
      obeyed.
      Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly
      word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
      me, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last.&nbsp; I am little better
      than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
      deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
      fire and deathless worm.&nbsp; Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this
      lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
      whom I was married lives!&nbsp; You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester
      at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time
      inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there
      under watch and ward.&nbsp; Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard
      half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress.&nbsp; I now inform you that she is
      my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name; sister
      of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and
      white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear.&nbsp; Cheer up,
      Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you.&nbsp; Bertha
      Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through
      three generations!&nbsp; Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a
      drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were
      silent on family secrets before.&nbsp; Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied
      her parent in both points.&nbsp; I had a charming partner—pure, wise, modest:
      you can fancy I was a happy man.&nbsp; I went through rich scenes!&nbsp; Oh! my
      experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it!&nbsp; But I owe you no
      further explanation.&nbsp; Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up
      to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and my wife!&nbsp; You shall
      see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether
      or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with
      something at least human.&nbsp; This girl,” he continued, looking at me,
      “knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all
      was fair and legal and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a
      feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and
      embruted partner!&nbsp; Come all of you—follow!”
      Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
      after.&nbsp; At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
      “Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it
      will not be wanted to-day.”
      At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
      greet us.
      “To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your
      congratulations!&nbsp; Who wants them?&nbsp; Not I!—they are fifteen years too
      late!”
      He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
      beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.&nbsp; We mounted the
      first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
      the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us
      to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
      “You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you
      here.”
      He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
      too, he opened.&nbsp; In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
      by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
      chain.&nbsp; Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in
      a saucepan.&nbsp; In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
      ran backwards and forwards.&nbsp; What it was, whether beast or human being,
      one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
      fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
      covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
      mane, hid its head and face.
      “Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; “How are you? and how is
      your charge to-day?”
      “We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling
      mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ‘rageous.”
      A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the
      clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
      “Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”
      “Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”
      “Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”
      The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
      gazed wildly at her visitors.&nbsp; I recognised well that purple face,—those
      bloated features.&nbsp; Mrs. Poole advanced.
      “Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she has
      no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”
      “One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
      mortal discretion to fathom her craft.”
      “We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.
      “Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.
      “‘Ware!” cried Grace.&nbsp; The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.&nbsp;
      Mr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his
      throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.&nbsp; She
      was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
      besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she
      almost throttled him, athletic as he was.&nbsp; He could have settled her
      with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only
      wrestle.&nbsp; At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and
      he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound
      her to a chair.&nbsp; The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells
      and the most convulsive plunges.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester then turned to the
      spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
      “That is my wife,” said he.&nbsp; “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
      ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
      hours!&nbsp; And this is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my
      shoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
      of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her
      just as a change after that fierce ragout.&nbsp; Wood and Briggs, look at the
      difference!&nbsp; Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this
      face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
      the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
      ye shall be judged!&nbsp; Off with you now.&nbsp; I must shut up my prize.”
      We all withdrew.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
      further order to Grace Poole.&nbsp; The solicitor addressed me as he
      descended the stair.
      “You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
      glad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason
      returns to Madeira.”
      “My uncle!&nbsp; What of him?&nbsp; Do you know him?”
      “Mr. Mason does.&nbsp; Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
      house for some years.&nbsp; When your uncle received your letter intimating
      the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,
      who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to
      Jamaica, happened to be with him.&nbsp; Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;
      for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the
      name of Rochester.&nbsp; Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may
      suppose, revealed the real state of matters.&nbsp; Your uncle, I am sorry to
      say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
      disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
      ever rise.&nbsp; He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate
      you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason
      to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.&nbsp; He
      referred him to me for assistance.&nbsp; I used all despatch, and am thankful
      I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.&nbsp; Were I not morally
      certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would
      advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had
      better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of
      Mr. Eyre.&nbsp; Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.
      “No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
      take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.&nbsp; The
      clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
      reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
      I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
      I had now withdrawn.&nbsp; The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
      bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep, not to mourn, I
      was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off the wedding
      dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
      thought, for the last time.&nbsp; I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.&nbsp; I
      leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.&nbsp; And now I
      thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved—followed up and down
      where I was led or dragged—watched event rush on event, disclosure open
      beyond disclosure: but now, I thought.
      The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene
      with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;
      there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no
      defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a
      calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short
      questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence
      adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;
      then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all
      was over.
      I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:
      nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.&nbsp; And yet where was
      the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her
      prospects?
      Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was a
      cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
      desolate.&nbsp; A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
      storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
      the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
      which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
      untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
      flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
      white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.&nbsp; My hopes were all dead—struck
      with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
      the land of Egypt.&nbsp; I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
      blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
      never revive.&nbsp; I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
      master’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
      child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
      seek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from his breast.&nbsp;
      Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted—confidence
      destroyed!&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
      what I had thought him.&nbsp; I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not
      say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone
      from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived
      well.&nbsp; When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I
      doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield.&nbsp; Real affection, it seemed,
      he could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was
      balked; he would want me no more.&nbsp; I should fear even to cross his path
      now: my view must be hateful to him.&nbsp; Oh, how blind had been my eyes!&nbsp;
      How weak my conduct!
      My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
      me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.&nbsp;
      Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down
      in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote
      mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I
      had no strength.&nbsp; I lay faint, longing to be dead.&nbsp; One idea only still
      throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered
      prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as
      something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express
      them—
      “Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”
      It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I
      had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it
      came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.&nbsp; The whole
      consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
      death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.&nbsp; That
      bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my
      soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;
      the floods overflowed me.”
