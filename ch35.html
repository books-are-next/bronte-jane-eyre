CHAPTER XXXIII
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
continued all night.&nbsp; The next day a keen wind brought fresh and
blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost
impassable.&nbsp; I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent
the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting
nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the
tempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—
“Day set on Norham’s castled steep,
 And Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And Cheviot’s mountains lone;
 The massive towers, the donjon keep,
 The flanking walls that round them sweep,
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In yellow lustre shone”—
I soon forgot storm in music.
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.&nbsp; No; it was St.
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.&nbsp; I was almost in
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
vale that night.
“Any ill news?” I demanded.&nbsp; “Has anything happened?”
“No.&nbsp; How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his cloak
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
the mat which his entrance had deranged.&nbsp; He stamped the snow from his
boots.
“I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must excuse
me for once.”&nbsp; Then he approached the fire.&nbsp; “I have had hard work to
get here, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the
flame.&nbsp; “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite
soft yet.”
“But why are you come?” I could not forbear saying.
“Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
mute books and empty rooms.&nbsp; Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
impatient to hear the sequel.”
He sat down.&nbsp; I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
began to fear his wits were touched.&nbsp; If he were insane, however, his
was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it
did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and
let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where
it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so
plainly graved.&nbsp; I waited, expecting he would say something I could at
least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his
lip: he was thinking.&nbsp; It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his
face.&nbsp; A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was
moved to say—
“I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
health.”
“Not at all,” said he: “I care for myself when necessary.&nbsp; I am well
now.&nbsp; What do you see amiss in me?”
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed
that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.&nbsp; I
was silenced.
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say
something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the
door, which was behind him.
“No, no!” he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
“Well,” I reflected, “if you won’t talk, you may be still; I’ll let you
alone now, and return to my book.”
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of “Marmion.”&nbsp; He soon
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.&nbsp; It was vain to try to
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
I would.
“Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?”
“Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.”
“There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?&nbsp; You
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?”
“I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.”&nbsp; Baffled so
far, I changed my ground.&nbsp; I bethought myself to talk about the school
and my scholars.
“Mary Garrett’s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
Close—they would have come to-day but for the snow.”
“Indeed!”
“Mr. Oliver pays for two.”
“Does he?”
“He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.”
“I know.”
“Was it your suggestion?”
“No.”
“Whose, then?”
“His daughter’s, I think.”
“It is like her: she is so good-natured.”
“Yes.”
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.&nbsp; It
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
“Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” he said.
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
“Half-an-hour ago,” he pursued, “I spoke of my impatience to hear the
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better
managed by my assuming the narrator’s part, and converting you into a
listener.&nbsp; Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story
will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often
regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips.&nbsp; For the
rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.
“Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment—fell
in love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with him, and
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
disowned her immediately after the wedding.&nbsp; Before two years passed,
the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one
slab.&nbsp; (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a
huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an
overgrown manufacturing town in ---shire.)&nbsp; They left a daughter, which,
at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as that of the
snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.&nbsp; Charity carried the
friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was
reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of
Gateshead.&nbsp; You start—did you hear a noise?&nbsp; I daresay it is only a rat
scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn
before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by
rats.—To proceed.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was
happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the
end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no other
than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.&nbsp; It seems her
career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher,
like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points in her
history and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again, your
fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a
certain Mr. Rochester.”
“Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.
“I can guess your feelings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.&nbsp; Of Mr. Rochester’s character
I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered
he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.&nbsp; What his subsequent conduct
and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how.&nbsp; She had
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
information could be gathered respecting her.&nbsp; Yet that she should be
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been
put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr.
Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.&nbsp; Is
it not an odd tale?”
“Just tell me this,” said I, “and since you know so much, you surely can
tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester?&nbsp; How and where is he?&nbsp; What is he
doing?&nbsp; Is he well?”
“I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never
mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have
adverted to.&nbsp; You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature
of the event which requires her appearance.”
“Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?&nbsp; Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”
“I suppose not.”
“But they wrote to him?”
“Of course.”
“And what did he say?&nbsp; Who has his letters?”
“Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from
Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
some former haunt on the Continent.&nbsp; And what opiate for his severe
sufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there?&nbsp; I
dared not answer the question.&nbsp; Oh, my poor master—once almost my
husband—whom I had often called “my dear Edward!”
“He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.
“You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” I said, with
warmth.
“Very well,” he answered quietly: “and indeed my head is otherwise
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.&nbsp; Since you won’t ask
the governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord.&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; I have it
here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
down, fairly committed to black and white.”
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
portrait-cover.&nbsp; He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words “Jane Eyre”—the work
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
“Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:” he said, “the advertisements
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
resolved into certainty.&nbsp; You own the name and renounce the alias?”
“Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?&nbsp; He perhaps knows more of Mr.
Rochester than you do.”
“Briggs is in London.&nbsp; I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.&nbsp; Meantime,
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
Mr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you.”
“Well, what did he want?”
“Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely
that—nothing more.”
“I!—rich?”
“Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”
Silence succeeded.
“You must prove your identity of course,” resumed St. John presently: “a
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
possession.&nbsp; Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
will and the necessary documents.”
Here was a new card turned up!&nbsp; It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a matter
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.&nbsp; And then there
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.&nbsp;
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got
a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder
business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and
we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
Death, Funeral.&nbsp; My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
day seeing him: now, I never should.&nbsp; And then this money came only to
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.&nbsp; It was a
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I felt
that—that thought swelled my heart.
“You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers.&nbsp; “I thought Medusa
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.&nbsp; Perhaps now you
will ask how much you are worth?”
“How much am I worth?”
“Oh, a trifle!&nbsp; Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I
think they say—but what is that?”
“Twenty thousand pounds?”
Here was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand.&nbsp;
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
“Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.”
“It is a large sum—don’t you think there is a mistake?”
“No mistake at all.”
“Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!”
“It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand.”
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
a hundred.&nbsp; Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
“If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “I would send Hannah
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
alone.&nbsp; But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as
I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e’en leave you to your
sorrows.&nbsp; Good-night.”
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.&nbsp; “Stop one
minute!” I cried.
“Well?”
“It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
place, had the power to aid in my discovery.”
“Oh!&nbsp; I am a clergyman,” he said; “and the clergy are often appealed to
about odd matters.”&nbsp; Again the latch rattled.
“No; that does not satisfy me!” I exclaimed: and indeed there was
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
“It is a very strange piece of business,” I added; “I must know more
about it.”
“Another time.”
“No; to-night!—to-night!” and as he turned from the door, I placed
myself between it and him.&nbsp; He looked rather embarrassed.
“You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said.
“I would rather not just now.”
“You shall!—you must!”
“I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.”
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified
it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
“But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to
persuade.”
“And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”
“And then,” he pursued, “I am cold: no fervour infects me.”
“Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.&nbsp; The blaze there has thawed
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to
my floor, and made it like a trampled street.&nbsp; As you hope ever to be
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.”
“Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.&nbsp; Besides, you must
know some day,—as well now as later.&nbsp; Your name is Jane Eyre?”
“Of course: that was all settled before.”
“You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?”
“No, indeed!&nbsp; I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
never asked for what name it stood.&nbsp; But what then?&nbsp; Surely—”
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a second,
stood out a strong, solid probability.&nbsp; Circumstances knit themselves,
fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying
hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every ring was
perfect, the connection complete.&nbsp; I knew, by instinct, how the matter
stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the
reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
explanation.
“My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.&nbsp; Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death,
and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
forgiven, between him and my father.&nbsp; He wrote again a few weeks since,
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
her.&nbsp; A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
her out.&nbsp; You know the rest.”&nbsp; Again he was going, but I set my back
against the door.
“Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have one moment to draw breath and
reflect.”&nbsp; I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
enough.&nbsp; I resumed—
“Your mother was my father’s sister?”
“Yes.”
“My aunt, consequently?”
He bowed.
“My uncle John was your uncle John?&nbsp; You, Diana, and Mary are his
sister’s children, as I am his brother’s child?”
“Undeniably.”
“You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
the same source?”
“We are cousins; yes.”
I surveyed him.&nbsp; It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
of,—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with
genuine affection and admiration.&nbsp; The two girls, on whom, kneeling down
on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor
House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and
despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who
had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.&nbsp;
Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch!&nbsp; This was wealth indeed!—wealth
to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections.&nbsp; This was a blessing,
bright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold:
rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.&nbsp; I now
clapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
“Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!” I exclaimed.
St. John smiled.&nbsp; “Did I not say you neglected essential points to
pursue trifles?” he asked.&nbsp; “You were serious when I told you you had
got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.”
“What can you mean?&nbsp; It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
don’t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,—or
two, if you don’t choose to be counted,—are born into my world
full-grown.&nbsp; I say again, I am glad!”
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
them:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
long.&nbsp; I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
stars,—every one lit me to a purpose or delight.&nbsp; Those who had saved my
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.&nbsp;
They were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
theirs too.&nbsp; Were we not four?&nbsp; Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
would be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would
be done,—mutual happiness secured.&nbsp; Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope,
enjoyment.
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.&nbsp; He also advised me
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
“Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” I said, “and tell them to come home
directly.&nbsp; Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.”
“Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,” said St. John; “you must
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.”
“Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?&nbsp;
Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle
down like an ordinary mortal?”
“You wander: your head becomes confused.&nbsp; I have been too abrupt in
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.”
“Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.”
“Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
comprehend better.”
“Explain!&nbsp; What is there to explain?&nbsp; You cannot fail to see that twenty
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?&nbsp; What I
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
fortune that has accrued to them.”
“To you, you mean.”
“I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
other.&nbsp; I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
ungrateful.&nbsp; Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.&nbsp;
I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.&nbsp; It would please
and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and
oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine
in justice, though it might in law.&nbsp; I abandon to you, then, what is
absolutely superfluous to me.&nbsp; Let there be no opposition, and no
discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the
point at once.”
“This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.”
“Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
the case?”
“I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.&nbsp;
Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own
efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.&nbsp;
After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear
conscience, consider it absolutely your own.”
“With me,” said I, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
opportunity of doing so.&nbsp; Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
myself lifelong friends.”
“You think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know what it
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a
notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the
place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would
open to you: you cannot—”
“And you,” I interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
fraternal and sisterly love.&nbsp; I never had a home, I never had brothers
or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to
admit me and own me, are you?”
“Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.”
“Brother?&nbsp; Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!&nbsp; Sisters?&nbsp; Yes;
slaving amongst strangers!&nbsp; I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned
and do not merit!&nbsp; You, penniless!&nbsp; Famous equality and fraternisation!&nbsp;
Close union!&nbsp; Intimate attachment!”
“But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness
may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may
marry.”
“Nonsense, again!&nbsp; Marry!&nbsp; I don’t want to marry, and never shall
marry.”
“That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
excitement under which you labour.”
“It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.&nbsp; No one would take me for
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
speculation.&nbsp; And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien,
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full
fellow-feeling.&nbsp; Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the
words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them
sincerely.”
“I think I can.&nbsp; I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know
on what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and
admiration of their talents.&nbsp; You too have principle and mind: your
tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
a salutary solace.&nbsp; I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”
“Thank you: that contents me for to-night.&nbsp; Now you had better go; for
if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some
mistrustful scruple.”
“And the school, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; It must now be shut up, I suppose?”
“No.&nbsp; I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.”
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments
I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.&nbsp; My
task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my
cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on
making a just division of the property—as they must in their own hearts
have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been
innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what
I wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the
affair to arbitration.&nbsp; The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able
lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.&nbsp; The
instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I,
each became possessed of a competency.

      CHAPTER XXXIII
      When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
      continued all night.&nbsp; The next day a keen wind brought fresh and
      blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost
      impassable.&nbsp; I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent
      the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting
      nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the
      tempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—
      “Day set on Norham’s castled steep,
      And Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And Cheviot’s mountains lone;
      The massive towers, the donjon keep,
      The flanking walls that round them sweep,
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In yellow lustre shone”—
      I soon forgot storm in music.
      I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.&nbsp; No; it was St.
      John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
      hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that
      covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.&nbsp; I was almost in
      consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
      vale that night.
      “Any ill news?” I demanded.&nbsp; “Has anything happened?”
      “No.&nbsp; How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his cloak
      and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
      the mat which his entrance had deranged.&nbsp; He stamped the snow from his
      boots.
      “I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must excuse
      me for once.”&nbsp; Then he approached the fire.&nbsp; “I have had hard work to
      get here, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the
      flame.&nbsp; “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite
      soft yet.”
      “But why are you come?” I could not forbear saying.
      “Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
      it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
      mute books and empty rooms.&nbsp; Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
      the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
      impatient to hear the sequel.”
      He sat down.&nbsp; I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
      began to fear his wits were touched.&nbsp; If he were insane, however, his
      was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
      handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it
      did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and
      let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where
      it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so
      plainly graved.&nbsp; I waited, expecting he would say something I could at
      least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his
      lip: he was thinking.&nbsp; It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his
      face.&nbsp; A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was
      moved to say—
      “I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
      you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
      health.”
      “Not at all,” said he: “I care for myself when necessary.&nbsp; I am well
      now.&nbsp; What do you see amiss in me?”
      This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed
      that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.&nbsp; I
      was silenced.
      He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
      dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say
      something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the
      door, which was behind him.
      “No, no!” he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
      “Well,” I reflected, “if you won’t talk, you may be still; I’ll let you
      alone now, and return to my book.”
      So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of “Marmion.”&nbsp; He soon
      stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
      morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
      folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.&nbsp; It was vain to try to
      read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
      impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
      I would.
      “Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?”
      “Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.”
      “There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?&nbsp; You
      will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?”
      “I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.”&nbsp; Baffled so
      far, I changed my ground.&nbsp; I bethought myself to talk about the school
      and my scholars.
      “Mary Garrett’s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
      morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
      Close—they would have come to-day but for the snow.”
      “Indeed!”
      “Mr. Oliver pays for two.”
      “Does he?”
      “He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.”
      “I know.”
      “Was it your suggestion?”
      “No.”
      “Whose, then?”
      “His daughter’s, I think.”
      “It is like her: she is so good-natured.”
      “Yes.”
      Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.&nbsp; It
      aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
      “Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” he said.
      Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
      “Half-an-hour ago,” he pursued, “I spoke of my impatience to hear the
      sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better
      managed by my assuming the narrator’s part, and converting you into a
      listener.&nbsp; Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story
      will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often
      regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips.&nbsp; For the
      rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.
      “Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment—fell
      in love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with him, and
      married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
      disowned her immediately after the wedding.&nbsp; Before two years passed,
      the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one
      slab.&nbsp; (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a
      huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an
      overgrown manufacturing town in ---shire.)&nbsp; They left a daughter, which,
      at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as that of the
      snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.&nbsp; Charity carried the
      friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was
      reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of
      Gateshead.&nbsp; You start—did you hear a noise?&nbsp; I daresay it is only a rat
      scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn
      before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by
      rats.—To proceed.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was
      happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the
      end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no other
      than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.&nbsp; It seems her
      career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher,
      like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points in her
      history and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again, your
      fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a
      certain Mr. Rochester.”
      “Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.
      “I can guess your feelings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I
      have nearly finished; hear me to the end.&nbsp; Of Mr. Rochester’s character
      I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
      marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered
      he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.&nbsp; What his subsequent conduct
      and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
      transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
      discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how.&nbsp; She had
      left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
      been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
      information could be gathered respecting her.&nbsp; Yet that she should be
      found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been
      put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr.
      Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.&nbsp; Is
      it not an odd tale?”
      “Just tell me this,” said I, “and since you know so much, you surely can
      tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester?&nbsp; How and where is he?&nbsp; What is he
      doing?&nbsp; Is he well?”
      “I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never
      mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have
      adverted to.&nbsp; You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature
      of the event which requires her appearance.”
      “Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?&nbsp; Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”
      “I suppose not.”
      “But they wrote to him?”
      “Of course.”
      “And what did he say?&nbsp; Who has his letters?”
      “Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from
      Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”
      I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
      in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
      some former haunt on the Continent.&nbsp; And what opiate for his severe
      sufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there?&nbsp; I
      dared not answer the question.&nbsp; Oh, my poor master—once almost my
      husband—whom I had often called “my dear Edward!”
      “He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.
      “You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” I said, with
      warmth.
      “Very well,” he answered quietly: “and indeed my head is otherwise
      occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.&nbsp; Since you won’t ask
      the governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord.&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; I have it
      here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
      down, fairly committed to black and white.”
      And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
      through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
      paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
      ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
      portrait-cover.&nbsp; He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
      in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words “Jane Eyre”—the work
      doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
      “Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:” he said, “the advertisements
      demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my
      suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
      resolved into certainty.&nbsp; You own the name and renounce the alias?”
      “Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?&nbsp; He perhaps knows more of Mr.
      Rochester than you do.”
      “Briggs is in London.&nbsp; I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
      Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.&nbsp; Meantime,
      you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
      Mr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you.”
      “Well, what did he want?”
      “Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
      he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely
      that—nothing more.”
      “I!—rich?”
      “Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”
      Silence succeeded.
      “You must prove your identity of course,” resumed St. John presently: “a
      step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
      possession.&nbsp; Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
      will and the necessary documents.”
      Here was a new card turned up!&nbsp; It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
      in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a matter
      one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.&nbsp; And then there
      are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this
      is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
      associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.&nbsp;
      One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got
      a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder
      business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and
      we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
      Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
      Death, Funeral.&nbsp; My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever
      since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
      day seeing him: now, I never should.&nbsp; And then this money came only to
      me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.&nbsp; It was a
      grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I felt
      that—that thought swelled my heart.
      “You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers.&nbsp; “I thought Medusa
      had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.&nbsp; Perhaps now you
      will ask how much you are worth?”
      “How much am I worth?”
      “Oh, a trifle!&nbsp; Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I
      think they say—but what is that?”
      “Twenty thousand pounds?”
      Here was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand.&nbsp;
      This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
      never heard laugh before, laughed now.
      “Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
      crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.”
      “It is a large sum—don’t you think there is a mistake?”
      “No mistake at all.”
      “Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!”
      “It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand.”
      I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
      powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
      a hundred.&nbsp; Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
      “If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “I would send Hannah
      down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
      alone.&nbsp; But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as
      I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e’en leave you to your
      sorrows.&nbsp; Good-night.”
      He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.&nbsp; “Stop one
      minute!” I cried.
      “Well?”
      “It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
      knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
      place, had the power to aid in my discovery.”
      “Oh!&nbsp; I am a clergyman,” he said; “and the clergy are often appealed to
      about odd matters.”&nbsp; Again the latch rattled.
      “No; that does not satisfy me!” I exclaimed: and indeed there was
      something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
      allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
      “It is a very strange piece of business,” I added; “I must know more
      about it.”
      “Another time.”
      “No; to-night!—to-night!” and as he turned from the door, I placed
      myself between it and him.&nbsp; He looked rather embarrassed.
      “You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said.
      “I would rather not just now.”
      “You shall!—you must!”
      “I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.”
      Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified
      it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
      “But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to
      persuade.”
      “And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”
      “And then,” he pursued, “I am cold: no fervour infects me.”
      “Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.&nbsp; The blaze there has thawed
      all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to
      my floor, and made it like a trampled street.&nbsp; As you hope ever to be
      forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
      sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.”
      “Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
      perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.&nbsp; Besides, you must
      know some day,—as well now as later.&nbsp; Your name is Jane Eyre?”
      “Of course: that was all settled before.”
      “You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was
      christened St. John Eyre Rivers?”
      “No, indeed!&nbsp; I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
      initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
      never asked for what name it stood.&nbsp; But what then?&nbsp; Surely—”
      I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
      the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a second,
      stood out a strong, solid probability.&nbsp; Circumstances knit themselves,
      fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying
      hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every ring was
      perfect, the connection complete.&nbsp; I knew, by instinct, how the matter
      stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the
      reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
      explanation.
      “My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
      married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
      merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.&nbsp; Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s
      solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death,
      and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s
      orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
      forgiven, between him and my father.&nbsp; He wrote again a few weeks since,
      to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
      her.&nbsp; A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
      her out.&nbsp; You know the rest.”&nbsp; Again he was going, but I set my back
      against the door.
      “Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have one moment to draw breath and
      reflect.”&nbsp; I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
      enough.&nbsp; I resumed—
      “Your mother was my father’s sister?”
      “Yes.”
      “My aunt, consequently?”
      He bowed.
      “My uncle John was your uncle John?&nbsp; You, Diana, and Mary are his
      sister’s children, as I am his brother’s child?”
      “Undeniably.”
      “You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
      the same source?”
      “We are cousins; yes.”
      I surveyed him.&nbsp; It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
      of,—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
      when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with
      genuine affection and admiration.&nbsp; The two girls, on whom, kneeling down
      on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor
      House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and
      despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who
      had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.&nbsp;
      Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch!&nbsp; This was wealth indeed!—wealth
      to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections.&nbsp; This was a blessing,
      bright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold:
      rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.&nbsp; I now
      clapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
      “Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!” I exclaimed.
      St. John smiled.&nbsp; “Did I not say you neglected essential points to
      pursue trifles?” he asked.&nbsp; “You were serious when I told you you had
      got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.”
      “What can you mean?&nbsp; It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
      don’t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,—or
      two, if you don’t choose to be counted,—are born into my world
      full-grown.&nbsp; I say again, I am glad!”
      I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
      thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
      them:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
      long.&nbsp; I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
      stars,—every one lit me to a purpose or delight.&nbsp; Those who had saved my
      life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.&nbsp;
      They were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could
      reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
      theirs too.&nbsp; Were we not four?&nbsp; Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
      would be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would
      be done,—mutual happiness secured.&nbsp; Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
      now it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope,
      enjoyment.
      How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
      tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
      and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.&nbsp; He also advised me
      to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
      distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
      “Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” I said, “and tell them to come home
      directly.&nbsp; Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
      thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.”
      “Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,” said St. John; “you must
      really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.”
      “Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?&nbsp;
      Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle
      down like an ordinary mortal?”
      “You wander: your head becomes confused.&nbsp; I have been too abrupt in
      communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.”
      “Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
      is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.”
      “Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
      comprehend better.”
      “Explain!&nbsp; What is there to explain?&nbsp; You cannot fail to see that twenty
      thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
      and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?&nbsp; What I
      want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
      fortune that has accrued to them.”
      “To you, you mean.”
      “I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
      other.&nbsp; I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
      ungrateful.&nbsp; Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.&nbsp;
      I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
      and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.&nbsp; It would please
      and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and
      oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine
      in justice, though it might in law.&nbsp; I abandon to you, then, what is
      absolutely superfluous to me.&nbsp; Let there be no opposition, and no
      discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the
      point at once.”
      “This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
      matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.”
      “Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
      the case?”
      “I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.&nbsp;
      Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own
      efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.&nbsp;
      After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear
      conscience, consider it absolutely your own.”
      “With me,” said I, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
      conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
      opportunity of doing so.&nbsp; Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
      year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
      glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
      myself lifelong friends.”
      “You think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know what it
      is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a
      notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the
      place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would
      open to you: you cannot—”
      “And you,” I interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
      fraternal and sisterly love.&nbsp; I never had a home, I never had brothers
      or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to
      admit me and own me, are you?”
      “Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without
      stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.”
      “Brother?&nbsp; Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!&nbsp; Sisters?&nbsp; Yes;
      slaving amongst strangers!&nbsp; I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned
      and do not merit!&nbsp; You, penniless!&nbsp; Famous equality and fraternisation!&nbsp;
      Close union!&nbsp; Intimate attachment!”
      “But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness
      may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may
      marry.”
      “Nonsense, again!&nbsp; Marry!&nbsp; I don’t want to marry, and never shall
      marry.”
      “That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
      excitement under which you labour.”
      “It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
      inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.&nbsp; No one would take me for
      love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
      speculation.&nbsp; And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien,
      different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full
      fellow-feeling.&nbsp; Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the
      words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them
      sincerely.”
      “I think I can.&nbsp; I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know
      on what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and
      admiration of their talents.&nbsp; You too have principle and mind: your
      tastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always
      agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
      a salutary solace.&nbsp; I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
      heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”
      “Thank you: that contents me for to-night.&nbsp; Now you had better go; for
      if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some
      mistrustful scruple.”
      “And the school, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; It must now be shut up, I suppose?”
      “No.&nbsp; I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.”
      He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
      I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments
      I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.&nbsp; My
      task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my
      cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on
      making a just division of the property—as they must in their own hearts
      have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been
      innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what
      I wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the
      affair to arbitration.&nbsp; The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able
      lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.&nbsp; The
      instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I,
      each became possessed of a competency.
