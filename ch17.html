CHAPTER XV
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.&nbsp; It was one
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and
while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up
and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a “grande
passion.”&nbsp; This passion Céline had professed to return with even
superior ardour.&nbsp; He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
believed, as he said, that she preferred his “taille d’athlète” to
the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the
Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;
gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres,
diamonds, dentelles, &amp;c.&nbsp; In short, I began the process of ruining
myself in the received style, like any other spoony.&nbsp; I had not, it
seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction,
but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch
from the beaten centre.&nbsp; I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all
other spoonies.&nbsp; Happening to call one evening when Céline did not
expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired
with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to
breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.&nbsp; No,—I
exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her:
it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk
and amber, than an odour of sanctity.&nbsp; I was just beginning to stifle
with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I
bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.&nbsp; It
was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.&nbsp; The
balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a
cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
the freezing and sunless air, he went on—
“I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
croquant—(overlook the barbarism)—croquant chocolate comfits,
and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled
along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when
in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English
horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised
the ‘voiture’ I had given Céline.&nbsp; She was returning: of course my heart
thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.&nbsp; The
carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that
is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a
cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June
evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the
skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step.&nbsp; Bending over
the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course,
which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped
from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel
which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now
passed under the arched porte cochère of the hotel.
“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; Of course not: I need not
ask you; because you never felt love.&nbsp; You have both sentiments yet to
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
waken it.&nbsp; You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
which your youth has hitherto slid away.&nbsp; Floating on with closed eyes
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.&nbsp; But I tell
you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy pass in
the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up into
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
current—as I am now.
“I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
stillness of the world under this frost.&nbsp; I like Thornfield, its
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
façade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
plague-house?&nbsp; How I do still abhor—”
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
boot against the hard ground.&nbsp; Some hated thought seemed to have him in
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before
us.&nbsp; Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such
as I never saw before or since.&nbsp; Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the
large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.&nbsp; Wild was the wrestle which
should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something
hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and
petrified his countenance: he went on—
“During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
my destiny.&nbsp; She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.&nbsp; ‘You like
Thornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can!&nbsp; Like
it if you dare!’
“‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and” (he subjoined moodily)
“I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
goodness—yes, goodness.&nbsp; I wish to be a better man than I have been,
than I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will
esteem but straw and rotten wood.”
Adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock.&nbsp; “Away!” he cried
harshly; “keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!”&nbsp; Continuing
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the
point whence he had abruptly diverged—
“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens entered?”
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.&nbsp; “Oh, I had
forgotten Céline!&nbsp; Well, to resume.&nbsp; When I saw my charmer thus come in
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core.&nbsp;
Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.&nbsp;
“Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young
lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it
were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories
of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!&nbsp; But
the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before:
you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the
recipient of secrets.&nbsp; Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed
in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take
infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.&nbsp; Happily I do not
mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.&nbsp; The
more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you
may refresh me.”&nbsp; After this digression he proceeded—
“I remained in the balcony.&nbsp; ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’
thought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’&nbsp; So putting my hand in through
the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening
through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all
but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’ whispered
vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came
in.&nbsp; My eye was quickly at the aperture.&nbsp; Céline’s chamber-maid entered,
lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.&nbsp; The couple were thus
revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was ‘the
Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and there was
her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a young roué
of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
absolutely.&nbsp; On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Céline sank
under an extinguisher.&nbsp; A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than
I, who had been her dupe.
“They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
than enrage a listener.&nbsp; A card of mine lay on the table; this being
perceived, brought my name under discussion.&nbsp; Neither of them possessed
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely
as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed
rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.&nbsp;
Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what
she called my ‘beauté mâle:’ wherein she differed diametrically from
you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not
think me handsome.&nbsp; The contrast struck me at the time and—”
Adèle here came running up again.
“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
wishes to see you.”
“Ah! in that case I must abridge.&nbsp; Opening the window, I walked in upon
them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded
screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an
appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.&nbsp;
Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in
one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the
pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.&nbsp; But unluckily the
Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she
affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no
proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more
like me than she.&nbsp; Some years after I had broken with the mother, she
abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.&nbsp; I
acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me, nor
do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she
was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud
of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome
soil of an English country garden.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it;
but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French
opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and
protégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have
found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,
&amp;c.—Eh?”
“No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall cling
closer to her than before.&nbsp; How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet
of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”
“Oh, that is the light in which you view it!&nbsp; Well, I must go in now;
and you too: it darkens.”
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.&nbsp; When we went
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
English mind.&nbsp; Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to
appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost.&nbsp; I sought in her
countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no
trait, no turn of expression announced relationship.&nbsp; It was a pity: if
she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought
more of her.
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.&nbsp; As he had
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance
of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French
dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no
doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the
paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act
of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.&nbsp; I meditated wonderingly on
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master’s manner to
myself.&nbsp; The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.&nbsp; His
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
the first.&nbsp; I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
benefit.
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with
relish.&nbsp; It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a
mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do
not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
him.&nbsp; I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
was his way.&nbsp; So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?&nbsp; No, reader: gratitude, and
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object
I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
brightest fire.&nbsp; Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could
not, for he brought them frequently before me.&nbsp; He was proud, sardonic,
harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that
his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many
others.&nbsp; He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when
sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with
his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,
almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features.&nbsp; But I believed that
his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say
former, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in
some cruel cross of fate.&nbsp; I believed he was naturally a man of better
tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as
circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny
encouraged.&nbsp; I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for
the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled.&nbsp; I cannot
deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have
given much to assuage it.
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I
could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,
and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be
happy at Thornfield.
“Why not?” I asked myself.&nbsp; “What alienates him from the house?&nbsp; Will he
leave it again soon?&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer
than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.&nbsp;
If he does go, the change will be doleful.&nbsp; Suppose he should be absent
spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will
seem!”
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
which sounded, I thought, just above me.&nbsp; I wished I had kept my candle
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.&nbsp; I rose
and sat up in bed, listening.&nbsp; The sound was hushed.
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
tranquillity was broken.&nbsp; The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.&nbsp;
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.&nbsp; I said,
“Who is there?”&nbsp; Nothing answered.&nbsp; I was chilled with fear.
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the
kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up
to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there
myself in the mornings.&nbsp; The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.&nbsp;
Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again
through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.&nbsp; But it
was not fated that I should sleep that night.&nbsp; A dream had scarcely
approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing
incident enough.
This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.&nbsp; The head of my bed was
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.&nbsp; My first impulse
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is
there?”
Something gurgled and moaned.&nbsp; Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I.&nbsp;
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.&nbsp; I
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
with a trembling hand.&nbsp; There was a candle burning just outside, and on
the matting in the gallery.&nbsp; I was surprised at this circumstance: but
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
burning.
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.
Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.&nbsp; I thought no
more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in
an instant, I was within the chamber.&nbsp; Tongues of flame darted round the
bed: the curtains were on fire.&nbsp; In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr.
Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
“Wake! wake!” I cried.&nbsp; I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:
the smoke had stupefied him.&nbsp; Not a moment could be lost: the very
sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one
was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water.&nbsp; I heaved
them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,
brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid,
succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I
flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of
the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.&nbsp;
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
water.
“Is there a flood?” he cried.
“No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.”
“In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he
demanded.&nbsp; “What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?&nbsp; Who is in the
room besides you?&nbsp; Have you plotted to drown me?”
“I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up.&nbsp;
Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and
what it is.”
“There!&nbsp; I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, here
is my dressing-gown.&nbsp; Now run!”
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.&nbsp; He
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened
and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
“What is it? and who did it?” he asked.&nbsp; I briefly related to him what
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,—the smell of fire which had
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
“Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.
“Mrs. Fairfax?&nbsp; No; what the deuce would you call her for?&nbsp; What can she
do?&nbsp; Let her sleep unmolested.”
“Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.”
“Not at all: just be still.&nbsp; You have a shawl on.&nbsp; If you are not warm
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on.&nbsp; Now place your feet on the
stool, to keep them out of the wet.&nbsp; I am going to leave you a few
minutes.&nbsp; I shall take the candle.&nbsp; Remain where you are till I return;
be as still as a mouse.&nbsp; I must pay a visit to the second storey.&nbsp; Don’t
move, remember, or call any one.”
He went: I watched the light withdraw.&nbsp; He passed up the gallery very
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.&nbsp; I was left in total
darkness.&nbsp; I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.&nbsp; A very long
time elapsed.&nbsp; I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and
then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.&nbsp;
I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying
his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,
and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting.&nbsp; “I hope it is he,”
thought I, “and not something worse.”
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.&nbsp; “I have found it all out,” said
he, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.”
“How, sir?”
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the
ground.&nbsp; At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar
tone—
“I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
door.”
“No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”
“But you heard an odd laugh?&nbsp; You have heard that laugh before, I should
think, or something like it?”
“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she
laughs in that way.&nbsp; She is a singular person.”
“Just so.&nbsp; Grace Poole—you have guessed it.&nbsp; She is, as you say,
singular—very.&nbsp; Well, I shall reflect on the subject.&nbsp; Meantime, I am
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
precise details of to-night’s incident.&nbsp; You are no talking fool: say
nothing about it.&nbsp; I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing
to the bed): “and now return to your own room.&nbsp; I shall do very well on
the sofa in the library for the rest of the night.&nbsp; It is near four:—in
two hours the servants will be up.”
“Good-night, then, sir,” said I, departing.
He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
go.
“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”
“You said I might go, sir.”
“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry
fashion.&nbsp; Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual
strangers!&nbsp; At least shake hands.”
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
both his own.
“You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
debt.&nbsp; I cannot say more.&nbsp; Nothing else that has being would have been
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but
his voice was checked.
“Good-night again, sir.&nbsp; There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
in the case.”
“I knew,” he continued, “you would do me good in some way, at some
time;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
and smile did not”—(again he stopped)—“did not” (he proceeded hastily)
“strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.&nbsp; People talk of
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of
truth in the wildest fable.&nbsp; My cherished preserver, goodnight!”
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
“I am glad I happened to be awake,” I said: and then I was going.
“What! you will go?”
“I am cold, sir.”
“Cold?&nbsp; Yes,—and standing in a pool!&nbsp; Go, then, Jane; go!”&nbsp; But he still
retained my hand, and I could not free it.&nbsp; I bethought myself of an
expedient.
“I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,” said I.
“Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.&nbsp; Till morning dawned I
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
under surges of joy.&nbsp; I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land,
and continually drove me back.&nbsp; Sense would resist delirium: judgment
would warn passion.&nbsp; Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.

      CHAPTER XV
      Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.&nbsp; It was one
      afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and
      while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up
      and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
      He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline
      Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a “grande
      passion.”&nbsp; This passion Céline had professed to return with even
      superior ardour.&nbsp; He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
      believed, as he said, that she preferred his “taille d’athlète” to
      the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
      “And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the
      Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;
      gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres,
      diamonds, dentelles, &amp;c.&nbsp; In short, I began the process of ruining
      myself in the received style, like any other spoony.&nbsp; I had not, it
      seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction,
      but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch
      from the beaten centre.&nbsp; I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all
      other spoonies.&nbsp; Happening to call one evening when Céline did not
      expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired
      with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to
      breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.&nbsp; No,—I
      exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her:
      it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk
      and amber, than an odour of sanctity.&nbsp; I was just beginning to stifle
      with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I
      bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.&nbsp; It
      was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.&nbsp; The
      balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a
      cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”
      Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
      having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
      the freezing and sunless air, he went on—
      “I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
      croquant—(overlook the barbarism)—croquant chocolate comfits,
      and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled
      along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when
      in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English
      horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised
      the ‘voiture’ I had given Céline.&nbsp; She was returning: of course my heart
      thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.&nbsp; The
      carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that
      is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a
      cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June
      evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the
      skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step.&nbsp; Bending over
      the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course,
      which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped
      from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel
      which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now
      passed under the arched porte cochère of the hotel.
      “You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; Of course not: I need not
      ask you; because you never felt love.&nbsp; You have both sentiments yet to
      experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
      waken it.&nbsp; You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
      which your youth has hitherto slid away.&nbsp; Floating on with closed eyes
      and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
      bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.&nbsp; But I tell
      you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy pass in
      the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up into
      whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
      crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
      current—as I am now.
      “I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
      stillness of the world under this frost.&nbsp; I like Thornfield, its
      antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
      façade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
      how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
      plague-house?&nbsp; How I do still abhor—”
      He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
      boot against the hard ground.&nbsp; Some hated thought seemed to have him in
      its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
      We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before
      us.&nbsp; Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such
      as I never saw before or since.&nbsp; Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
      detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the
      large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.&nbsp; Wild was the wrestle which
      should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something
      hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and
      petrified his countenance: he went on—
      “During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
      my destiny.&nbsp; She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of
      those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.&nbsp; ‘You like
      Thornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
      a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
      between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can!&nbsp; Like
      it if you dare!’
      “‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and” (he subjoined moodily)
      “I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
      goodness—yes, goodness.&nbsp; I wish to be a better man than I have been,
      than I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
      habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will
      esteem but straw and rotten wood.”
      Adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock.&nbsp; “Away!” he cried
      harshly; “keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!”&nbsp; Continuing
      then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the
      point whence he had abruptly diverged—
      “Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens entered?”
      I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
      the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
      towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.&nbsp; “Oh, I had
      forgotten Céline!&nbsp; Well, to resume.&nbsp; When I saw my charmer thus come in
      accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
      of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
      within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core.&nbsp;
      Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.&nbsp;
      “Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young
      lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it
      were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories
      of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!&nbsp; But
      the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before:
      you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the
      recipient of secrets.&nbsp; Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed
      in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take
      infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.&nbsp; Happily I do not
      mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.&nbsp; The
      more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you
      may refresh me.”&nbsp; After this digression he proceeded—
      “I remained in the balcony.&nbsp; ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’
      thought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’&nbsp; So putting my hand in through
      the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening
      through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all
      but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’ whispered
      vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came
      in.&nbsp; My eye was quickly at the aperture.&nbsp; Céline’s chamber-maid entered,
      lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.&nbsp; The couple were thus
      revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was ‘the
      Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and there was
      her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a young roué
      of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
      society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
      absolutely.&nbsp; On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
      instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Céline sank
      under an extinguisher.&nbsp; A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
      not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than
      I, who had been her dupe.
      “They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
      mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
      than enrage a listener.&nbsp; A card of mine lay on the table; this being
      perceived, brought my name under discussion.&nbsp; Neither of them possessed
      energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely
      as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed
      rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.&nbsp;
      Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what
      she called my ‘beauté mâle:’ wherein she differed diametrically from
      you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not
      think me handsome.&nbsp; The contrast struck me at the time and—”
      Adèle here came running up again.
      “Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
      wishes to see you.”
      “Ah! in that case I must abridge.&nbsp; Opening the window, I walked in upon
      them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
      hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded
      screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an
      appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.&nbsp;
      Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in
      one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the
      pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.&nbsp; But unluckily the
      Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she
      affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no
      proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more
      like me than she.&nbsp; Some years after I had broken with the mother, she
      abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.&nbsp; I
      acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me, nor
      do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she
      was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud
      of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome
      soil of an English country garden.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it;
      but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French
      opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and
      protégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have
      found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,
      &amp;c.—Eh?”
      “No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I
      have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
      parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall cling
      closer to her than before.&nbsp; How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet
      of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
      lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”
      “Oh, that is the light in which you view it!&nbsp; Well, I must go in now;
      and you too: it darkens.”
      But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race
      with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.&nbsp; When we went
      in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
      her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
      even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
      stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
      character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
      English mind.&nbsp; Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to
      appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost.&nbsp; I sought in her
      countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no
      trait, no turn of expression announced relationship.&nbsp; It was a pity: if
      she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought
      more of her.
      It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
      that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.&nbsp; As he had
      said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance
      of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French
      dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no
      doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the
      paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act
      of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
      pleasure in the old hall and its environs.&nbsp; I meditated wonderingly on
      this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
      inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master’s manner to
      myself.&nbsp; The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
      tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.&nbsp; His
      deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
      the first.&nbsp; I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
      hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
      had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
      invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
      that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
      these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
      benefit.
      I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with
      relish.&nbsp; It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a
      mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do
      not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
      interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
      novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
      receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
      portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
      disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
      The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
      frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
      him.&nbsp; I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
      yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
      was his way.&nbsp; So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
      added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
      crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
      up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
      And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?&nbsp; No, reader: gratitude, and
      many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object
      I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
      brightest fire.&nbsp; Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could
      not, for he brought them frequently before me.&nbsp; He was proud, sardonic,
      harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that
      his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many
      others.&nbsp; He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when
      sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with
      his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,
      almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features.&nbsp; But I believed that
      his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say
      former, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in
      some cruel cross of fate.&nbsp; I believed he was naturally a man of better
      tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as
      circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny
      encouraged.&nbsp; I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for
      the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled.&nbsp; I cannot
      deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have
      given much to assuage it.
      Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I
      could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,
      and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be
      happy at Thornfield.
      “Why not?” I asked myself.&nbsp; “What alienates him from the house?&nbsp; Will he
      leave it again soon?&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer
      than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.&nbsp;
      If he does go, the change will be doleful.&nbsp; Suppose he should be absent
      spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will
      seem!”
      I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
      I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
      which sounded, I thought, just above me.&nbsp; I wished I had kept my candle
      burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.&nbsp; I rose
      and sat up in bed, listening.&nbsp; The sound was hushed.
      I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
      tranquillity was broken.&nbsp; The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.&nbsp;
      Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
      the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.&nbsp; I said,
      “Who is there?”&nbsp; Nothing answered.&nbsp; I was chilled with fear.
      All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the
      kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up
      to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there
      myself in the mornings.&nbsp; The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.&nbsp;
      Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again
      through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.&nbsp; But it
      was not fated that I should sleep that night.&nbsp; A dream had scarcely
      approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing
      incident enough.
      This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it
      seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.&nbsp; The head of my bed was
      near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
      bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
      could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
      reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.&nbsp; My first impulse
      was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is
      there?”
      Something gurgled and moaned.&nbsp; Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
      towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
      in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
      “Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I.&nbsp;
      Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.&nbsp; I
      hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
      with a trembling hand.&nbsp; There was a candle burning just outside, and on
      the matting in the gallery.&nbsp; I was surprised at this circumstance: but
      still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
      smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
      these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
      burning.
      Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.
      Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.&nbsp; I thought no
      more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in
      an instant, I was within the chamber.&nbsp; Tongues of flame darted round the
      bed: the curtains were on fire.&nbsp; In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr.
      Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
      “Wake! wake!” I cried.&nbsp; I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:
      the smoke had stupefied him.&nbsp; Not a moment could be lost: the very
      sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one
      was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water.&nbsp; I heaved
      them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,
      brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid,
      succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
      The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I
      flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of
      the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.&nbsp;
      Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
      fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
      water.
      “Is there a flood?” he cried.
      “No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
      quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.”
      “In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he
      demanded.&nbsp; “What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?&nbsp; Who is in the
      room besides you?&nbsp; Have you plotted to drown me?”
      “I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up.&nbsp;
      Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and
      what it is.”
      “There!&nbsp; I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
      minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, here
      is my dressing-gown.&nbsp; Now run!”
      I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.&nbsp; He
      took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened
      and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
      “What is it? and who did it?” he asked.&nbsp; I briefly related to him what
      had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
      ascending to the third storey; the smoke,—the smell of fire which had
      conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
      how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
      He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
      than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
      “Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.
      “Mrs. Fairfax?&nbsp; No; what the deuce would you call her for?&nbsp; What can she
      do?&nbsp; Let her sleep unmolested.”
      “Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.”
      “Not at all: just be still.&nbsp; You have a shawl on.&nbsp; If you are not warm
      enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
      the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on.&nbsp; Now place your feet on the
      stool, to keep them out of the wet.&nbsp; I am going to leave you a few
      minutes.&nbsp; I shall take the candle.&nbsp; Remain where you are till I return;
      be as still as a mouse.&nbsp; I must pay a visit to the second storey.&nbsp; Don’t
      move, remember, or call any one.”
      He went: I watched the light withdraw.&nbsp; He passed up the gallery very
      softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
      shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.&nbsp; I was left in total
      darkness.&nbsp; I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.&nbsp; A very long
      time elapsed.&nbsp; I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and
      then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.&nbsp;
      I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying
      his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,
      and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting.&nbsp; “I hope it is he,”
      thought I, “and not something worse.”
      He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.&nbsp; “I have found it all out,” said
      he, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.”
      “How, sir?”
      He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the
      ground.&nbsp; At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar
      tone—
      “I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
      door.”
      “No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”
      “But you heard an odd laugh?&nbsp; You have heard that laugh before, I should
      think, or something like it?”
      “Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she
      laughs in that way.&nbsp; She is a singular person.”
      “Just so.&nbsp; Grace Poole—you have guessed it.&nbsp; She is, as you say,
      singular—very.&nbsp; Well, I shall reflect on the subject.&nbsp; Meantime, I am
      glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
      precise details of to-night’s incident.&nbsp; You are no talking fool: say
      nothing about it.&nbsp; I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing
      to the bed): “and now return to your own room.&nbsp; I shall do very well on
      the sofa in the library for the rest of the night.&nbsp; It is near four:—in
      two hours the servants will be up.”
      “Good-night, then, sir,” said I, departing.
      He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
      go.
      “What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”
      “You said I might go, sir.”
      “But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
      acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry
      fashion.&nbsp; Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and
      excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual
      strangers!&nbsp; At least shake hands.”
      He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
      both his own.
      “You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
      debt.&nbsp; I cannot say more.&nbsp; Nothing else that has being would have been
      tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
      you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”
      He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but
      his voice was checked.
      “Good-night again, sir.&nbsp; There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
      in the case.”
      “I knew,” he continued, “you would do me good in some way, at some
      time;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
      and smile did not”—(again he stopped)—“did not” (he proceeded hastily)
      “strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.&nbsp; People talk of
      natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of
      truth in the wildest fable.&nbsp; My cherished preserver, goodnight!”
      Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
      “I am glad I happened to be awake,” I said: and then I was going.
      “What! you will go?”
      “I am cold, sir.”
      “Cold?&nbsp; Yes,—and standing in a pool!&nbsp; Go, then, Jane; go!”&nbsp; But he still
      retained my hand, and I could not free it.&nbsp; I bethought myself of an
      expedient.
      “I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,” said I.
      “Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
      I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.&nbsp; Till morning dawned I
      was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
      under surges of joy.&nbsp; I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
      shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
      wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
      could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land,
      and continually drove me back.&nbsp; Sense would resist delirium: judgment
      would warn passion.&nbsp; Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
