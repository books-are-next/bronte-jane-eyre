CHAPTER IV
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I desired and
waited it in silence.&nbsp; It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
subject over which I brooded.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own
children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning
me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my
cousins were constantly in the drawing-room.&nbsp; Not a hint, however, did
she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive
certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with
her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an
insuperable and rooted aversion.
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me
as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he
saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned
against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate
revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to
desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst
his nose.&nbsp; I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a
blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my
look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my
advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama.&nbsp; I heard him in
a blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had
flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—
“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
should associate with her.”
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at
all deliberating on my words—
“They are not fit to associate with me.”
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
syllable during the remainder of the day.
“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely
voluntary demand.&nbsp; I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my
arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child
or fiend.&nbsp; I was now in for it.
“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so
can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how
you wish me dead.”
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
both my ears, and then left me without a word.&nbsp; Bessie supplied the
hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond a
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
roof.&nbsp; I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
in my breast.
November, December, and half of January passed away.&nbsp; Christmas and the
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.&nbsp; From
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,
and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.&nbsp; When
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
miserable.&nbsp; To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been
kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the
evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable
eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; But Bessie,
as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to
the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally
bearing the candle along with her.&nbsp; I then sat with my doll on my knee
till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that
nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers
sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as
I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.&nbsp; To
this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and,
in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a
pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a
miniature scarecrow.&nbsp; It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd
sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and
capable of sensation.&nbsp; I could not sleep unless it was folded in my
night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively
happy, believing it to be happy likewise.
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes she
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a
cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
and said, “Good night, Miss Jane.”&nbsp; When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to
me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
wont to do.&nbsp; Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack
of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by
her nursery tales.&nbsp; She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face
and person are correct.&nbsp; I remember her as a slim young woman, with
black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion;
but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of
principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one
else at Gateshead Hall.
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning:
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to
go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not
less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money
she thus obtained.&nbsp; She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity
for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also
in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds,
and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to
buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to
sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have
made a handsome profit thereby.&nbsp; As to her money, she first secreted it
in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these
hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one
day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother,
at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest
she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with
anxious accuracy.
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.&nbsp; I was making my
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of
under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &amp;c.).&nbsp; Having
spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to
put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered
there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for
the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her
property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other
occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the
window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which
I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under
the influence of a hard frost.
From this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road,
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
carriage roll through.&nbsp; I watched it ascending the drive with
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.&nbsp; All this being
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the
twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the
casement.&nbsp; The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the
table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash
to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running
upstairs into the nursery.
“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?&nbsp; Have you
washed your hands and face this morning?”&nbsp; I gave another tug before I
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—
“No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.”
“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?&nbsp; You look
quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening
the window for?”
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
me.&nbsp; I slowly descended.&nbsp; For nearly three months, I had never been
called to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions,
on which it dismayed me to intrude.
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door,
and I stopped, intimidated and trembling.&nbsp; What a miserable little
poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those
days!&nbsp; I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to
the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement
ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.
“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.&nbsp;
“What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a
woman?”&nbsp; The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and
curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared
to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing
erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,
placed above the shaft by way of capital.
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
with the words: “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
you.”
He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,
and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass
voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”
“Ten years.”
“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
some minutes.&nbsp; Presently he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”
“Jane Eyre, sir.”
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all
the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
contrary opinion: I was silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on
that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”
“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bending
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair
opposite Mrs. Reed’s.&nbsp; “Come here,” he said.
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.&nbsp;
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a
naughty little girl.&nbsp; Do you know where the wicked go after death?”
“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer.
“And what is hell?&nbsp; Can you tell me that?”
“A pit full of fire.”
“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
ever?”
“No, sir.”
“What must you do to avoid it?”
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
“I must keep in good health, and not die.”
“How can you keep in good health?&nbsp; Children younger than you die daily.&nbsp;
I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a
good little child, whose soul is now in heaven.&nbsp; It is to be feared the
same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.”
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down
on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
enough away.
“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.”
“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”
“Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my interrogator.
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you read your Bible?”
“Sometimes.”
“With pleasure?&nbsp; Are you fond of it?”
“I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
and Jonah.”
“And the Psalms?&nbsp; I hope you like them?”
“No, sir.”
“No? oh, shocking!&nbsp; I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a little
angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
piety.”
“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.
“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone
and give you a heart of flesh.”
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
conversation herself.
“Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
tendency to deceit.&nbsp; I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her
nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however
carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my
efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.&nbsp;
Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I
dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new
phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I
could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and
unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.
Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to
remedy the injury?
“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
Reed.&nbsp; I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”
“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,”
continued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
Lowood.”
“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr.
Brocklehurst.&nbsp; “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.&nbsp; I have studied
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only
the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.&nbsp; My second
daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her
return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls
at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long
pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they
are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked at
my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.’”
“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had
I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.&nbsp; Consistency, my dear Mr.
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”
“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of
Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy
and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
inhabitants.”
“Quite right, sir.&nbsp; I may then depend upon this child being received as
a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
and prospects?”
“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
of her election.”
“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
becoming too irksome.”
“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.&nbsp; I shall
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.&nbsp; I shall
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
will be no difficulty about receiving her.&nbsp; Good-bye.”
“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”
“I will, madam.&nbsp; Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s
Guide,’ read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
falsehood and deceit.’”
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
sewing, I was watching her.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a
somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid;
her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose
sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid
of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her
constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was an
exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under
her control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed
it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to
set off handsome attire.
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
figure; I perused her features.&nbsp; In my hand I held the tract containing
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
pointed as to an appropriate warning.&nbsp; What had just passed; what Mrs.
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of
their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt
every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of
resentment fomented now within me.
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate.&nbsp; My look
or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
extreme though suppressed irritation.&nbsp; I got up, I went to the door; I
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
to her.
Speak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but
how?&nbsp; What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?&nbsp; I
gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—
“I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare
I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world
except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your
girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.”
Mrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which a
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
used to a child.
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.&nbsp; Shaking
from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—
“I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
as long as I live.&nbsp; I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
miserable cruelty.”
“How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”
“How dare I, Mrs. Reed?&nbsp; How dare I?&nbsp; Because it is the truth.&nbsp; You
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.&nbsp; I shall remember
how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in
agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have
mercy!&nbsp; Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’&nbsp; And that punishment you made me suffer
because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing.&nbsp; I will
tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale.&nbsp; People think you a
good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted.&nbsp; You are deceitful!”
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.&nbsp; It seemed as
if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into
unhoped-for liberty.&nbsp; Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed
looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting
up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as
if she would cry.
“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?&nbsp; Why do you
tremble so violently?&nbsp; Would you like to drink some water?”
“No, Mrs. Reed.”
“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?&nbsp; I assure you, I desire to
be your friend.”
“Not you.&nbsp; You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and
what you have done.”
“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected for
their faults.”
“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.
“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to
the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”
“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
Reed, for I hate to live here.”
“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed sotto
voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
I was left there alone—winner of the field.&nbsp; It was the hardest battle I
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s
solitude.&nbsp; First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
pulses.&nbsp; A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,
without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of
reaction.&nbsp; A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would
have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed:
the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.&nbsp; Willingly
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I knew, partly
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent
impulse of my nature.
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
indignation.&nbsp; I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and
endeavoured to read.&nbsp; I could make no sense of the subject; my own
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
fascinating.&nbsp; I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
breeze, through the grounds.&nbsp; I covered my head and arms with the skirt
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.&nbsp; I leaned against a
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
the short grass was nipped and blanched.&nbsp; It was a very grey day; a most
opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes felt it
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
melting.&nbsp; I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over
and over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”
All at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you?&nbsp; Come
to lunch!”
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
came tripping down the path.
“You naughty little thing!” she said.&nbsp; “Why don’t you come when you are
called?”
Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat
cross.&nbsp; The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,
I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger;
and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.&nbsp; I just
put my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at
me; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
suppose?”
I nodded.
“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”
“What does Bessie care for me?&nbsp; She is always scolding me.”
“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.&nbsp; You should
be bolder.”
“What! to get more knocks?”
“Nonsense!&nbsp; But you are rather put upon, that’s certain.&nbsp; My mother
said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a
little one of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some
good news for you.”
“I don’t think you have, Bessie.”
“Child! what do you mean?&nbsp; What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!&nbsp; Well, but
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.&nbsp; I’ll ask cook to bake you a
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
am soon to pack your trunk.&nbsp; Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.”
“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.”
“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid of
me.&nbsp; Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so
provoking.”
“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
dread.”
“If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”
“As you do, Bessie?”
“I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
others.”
“You don’t show it.”
“You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talking.&nbsp; What
makes you so venturesome and hardy?”
“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
“And so you’re glad to leave me?”
“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”
“Just now! and rather!&nbsp; How coolly my little lady says it!&nbsp; I dare say
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say
you’d rather not.”
“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.”&nbsp; Bessie stooped; we
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.&nbsp;
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
sweetest songs.&nbsp; Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.

      CHAPTER IV
      From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
      between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
      motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I desired and
      waited it in silence.&nbsp; It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
      regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
      subject over which I brooded.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
      severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
      more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own
      children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning
      me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my
      cousins were constantly in the drawing-room.&nbsp; Not a hint, however, did
      she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive
      certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with
      her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an
      insuperable and rooted aversion.
      Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me
      as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he
      saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned
      against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate
      revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to
      desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst
      his nose.&nbsp; I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a
      blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my
      look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my
      advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama.&nbsp; I heard him in
      a blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had
      flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—
      “Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
      not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
      should associate with her.”
      Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at
      all deliberating on my words—
      “They are not fit to associate with me.”
      Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
      audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
      whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
      dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
      syllable during the remainder of the day.
      “What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely
      voluntary demand.&nbsp; I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
      tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
      something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
      “What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
      eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my
      arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child
      or fiend.&nbsp; I was now in for it.
      “My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so
      can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how
      you wish me dead.”
      Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
      both my ears, and then left me without a word.&nbsp; Bessie supplied the
      hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond a
      doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
      roof.&nbsp; I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
      in my breast.
      November, December, and half of January passed away.&nbsp; Christmas and the
      New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
      presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.&nbsp; From
      every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
      consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,
      and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
      frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
      afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
      below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
      jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
      hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.&nbsp; When
      tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
      solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
      miserable.&nbsp; To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
      for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been
      kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the
      evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable
      eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; But Bessie,
      as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to
      the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally
      bearing the candle along with her.&nbsp; I then sat with my doll on my knee
      till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that
      nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers
      sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as
      I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.&nbsp; To
      this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and,
      in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a
      pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a
      miniature scarecrow.&nbsp; It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd
      sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and
      capable of sensation.&nbsp; I could not sleep unless it was folded in my
      night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively
      happy, believing it to be happy likewise.
      Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
      listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes she
      would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
      perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a
      cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
      finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
      and said, “Good night, Miss Jane.”&nbsp; When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to
      me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
      intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
      push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
      wont to do.&nbsp; Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
      capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack
      of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by
      her nursery tales.&nbsp; She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face
      and person are correct.&nbsp; I remember her as a slim young woman, with
      black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion;
      but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of
      principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one
      else at Gateshead Hall.
      It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning:
      Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
      to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to
      go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not
      less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money
      she thus obtained.&nbsp; She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity
      for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also
      in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds,
      and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to
      buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to
      sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have
      made a handsome profit thereby.&nbsp; As to her money, she first secreted it
      in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these
      hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one
      day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother,
      at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest
      she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with
      anxious accuracy.
      Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
      interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
      which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.&nbsp; I was making my
      bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
      she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of
      under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &amp;c.).&nbsp; Having
      spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to
      put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered
      there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for
      the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her
      property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other
      occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the
      window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which
      I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under
      the influence of a hard frost.
      From this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road,
      and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
      the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
      carriage roll through.&nbsp; I watched it ascending the drive with
      indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
      visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
      door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.&nbsp; All this being
      nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
      spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the
      twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the
      casement.&nbsp; The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the
      table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash
      to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running
      upstairs into the nursery.
      “Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?&nbsp; Have you
      washed your hands and face this morning?”&nbsp; I gave another tug before I
      answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
      yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
      cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—
      “No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.”
      “Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?&nbsp; You look
      quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening
      the window for?”
      I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
      hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
      inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
      soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
      brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
      stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
      I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
      there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
      me.&nbsp; I slowly descended.&nbsp; For nearly three months, I had never been
      called to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
      breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions,
      on which it dismayed me to intrude.
      I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door,
      and I stopped, intimidated and trembling.&nbsp; What a miserable little
      poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those
      days!&nbsp; I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to
      the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement
      ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.
      “Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
      stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.&nbsp;
      “What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a
      woman?”&nbsp; The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and
      curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared
      to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing
      erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,
      placed above the shaft by way of capital.
      Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
      me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
      with the words: “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
      you.”
      He, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,
      and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
      twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass
      voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”
      “Ten years.”
      “So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
      some minutes.&nbsp; Presently he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”
      “Jane Eyre, sir.”
      In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
      but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all
      the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
      “Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”
      Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
      contrary opinion: I was silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
      expressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on
      that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”
      “Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bending
      from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair
      opposite Mrs. Reed’s.&nbsp; “Come here,” he said.
      I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.&nbsp;
      What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
      great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
      “No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a
      naughty little girl.&nbsp; Do you know where the wicked go after death?”
      “They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer.
      “And what is hell?&nbsp; Can you tell me that?”
      “A pit full of fire.”
      “And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
      ever?”
      “No, sir.”
      “What must you do to avoid it?”
      I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
      “I must keep in good health, and not die.”
      “How can you keep in good health?&nbsp; Children younger than you die daily.&nbsp;
      I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a
      good little child, whose soul is now in heaven.&nbsp; It is to be feared the
      same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.”
      Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down
      on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
      enough away.
      “I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
      been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.”
      “Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed
      my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”
      “Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my interrogator.
      “Yes, sir.”
      “Do you read your Bible?”
      “Sometimes.”
      “With pleasure?&nbsp; Are you fond of it?”
      “I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
      a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
      and Jonah.”
      “And the Psalms?&nbsp; I hope you like them?”
      “No, sir.”
      “No? oh, shocking!&nbsp; I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
      Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
      gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the
      verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a little
      angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
      piety.”
      “Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.
      “That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
      it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone
      and give you a heart of flesh.”
      I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
      operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
      interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
      conversation herself.
      “Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
      you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
      and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
      should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
      a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
      tendency to deceit.&nbsp; I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
      not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”
      Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her
      nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however
      carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my
      efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.&nbsp;
      Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I
      dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new
      phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I
      could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and
      unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.
      Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to
      remedy the injury?
      “Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
      hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
      “Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it
      is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
      burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
      Reed.&nbsp; I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”
      “I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,”
      continued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
      the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
      Lowood.”
      “Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr.
      Brocklehurst.&nbsp; “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
      appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
      care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.&nbsp; I have studied
      how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only
      the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.&nbsp; My second
      daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her
      return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls
      at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long
      pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they
      are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked at
      my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.’”
      “This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had
      I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
      exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.&nbsp; Consistency, my dear Mr.
      Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”
      “Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
      observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of
      Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy
      and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
      inhabitants.”
      “Quite right, sir.&nbsp; I may then depend upon this child being received as
      a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
      and prospects?”
      “Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
      and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
      of her election.”
      “I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
      assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
      becoming too irksome.”
      “No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.&nbsp; I shall
      return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
      friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.&nbsp; I shall
      send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
      will be no difficulty about receiving her.&nbsp; Good-bye.”
      “Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
      and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”
      “I will, madam.&nbsp; Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s
      Guide,’ read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account
      of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
      falsehood and deceit.’”
      With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
      in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
      Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
      sewing, I was watching her.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
      seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
      strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a
      somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid;
      her brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose
      sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid
      of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her
      constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was an
      exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under
      her control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed
      it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to
      set off handsome attire.
      Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
      figure; I perused her features.&nbsp; In my hand I held the tract containing
      the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
      pointed as to an appropriate warning.&nbsp; What had just passed; what Mrs.
      Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of
      their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt
      every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of
      resentment fomented now within me.
      Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
      at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
      “Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate.&nbsp; My look
      or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
      extreme though suppressed irritation.&nbsp; I got up, I went to the door; I
      came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
      to her.
      Speak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but
      how?&nbsp; What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?&nbsp; I
      gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—
      “I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare
      I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world
      except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your
      girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.”
      Mrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
      continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
      “What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which a
      person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
      used to a child.
      That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.&nbsp; Shaking
      from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—
      “I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
      as long as I live.&nbsp; I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
      if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
      the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
      miserable cruelty.”
      “How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”
      “How dare I, Mrs. Reed?&nbsp; How dare I?&nbsp; Because it is the truth.&nbsp; You
      think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
      kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.&nbsp; I shall remember
      how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the
      red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in
      agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have
      mercy!&nbsp; Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’&nbsp; And that punishment you made me suffer
      because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing.&nbsp; I will
      tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale.&nbsp; People think you a
      good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted.&nbsp; You are deceitful!”
      Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
      the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.&nbsp; It seemed as
      if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into
      unhoped-for liberty.&nbsp; Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed
      looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting
      up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as
      if she would cry.
      “Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?&nbsp; Why do you
      tremble so violently?&nbsp; Would you like to drink some water?”
      “No, Mrs. Reed.”
      “Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?&nbsp; I assure you, I desire to
      be your friend.”
      “Not you.&nbsp; You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
      disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and
      what you have done.”
      “Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected for
      their faults.”
      “Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.
      “But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to
      the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”
      “I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
      Reed, for I hate to live here.”
      “I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed sotto
      voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
      I was left there alone—winner of the field.&nbsp; It was the hardest battle I
      had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
      rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s
      solitude.&nbsp; First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
      pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
      pulses.&nbsp; A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
      give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,
      without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of
      reaction.&nbsp; A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would
      have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed:
      the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
      represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s
      silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
      dreariness of my hated and hating position.
      Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
      it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
      corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.&nbsp; Willingly
      would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I knew, partly
      from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
      repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent
      impulse of my nature.
      I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
      fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
      indignation.&nbsp; I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and
      endeavoured to read.&nbsp; I could make no sense of the subject; my own
      thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
      fascinating.&nbsp; I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
      shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
      breeze, through the grounds.&nbsp; I covered my head and arms with the skirt
      of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
      quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
      falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
      by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.&nbsp; I leaned against a
      gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
      the short grass was nipped and blanched.&nbsp; It was a very grey day; a most
      opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes felt it
      intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
      melting.&nbsp; I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over
      and over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”
      All at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you?&nbsp; Come
      to lunch!”
      It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
      came tripping down the path.
      “You naughty little thing!” she said.&nbsp; “Why don’t you come when you are
      called?”
      Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
      brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat
      cross.&nbsp; The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,
      I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger;
      and I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.&nbsp; I just
      put my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”
      The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
      indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
      “You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at
      me; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
      suppose?”
      I nodded.
      “And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”
      “What does Bessie care for me?&nbsp; She is always scolding me.”
      “Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.&nbsp; You should
      be bolder.”
      “What! to get more knocks?”
      “Nonsense!&nbsp; But you are rather put upon, that’s certain.&nbsp; My mother
      said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a
      little one of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some
      good news for you.”
      “I don’t think you have, Bessie.”
      “Child! what do you mean?&nbsp; What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!&nbsp; Well, but
      Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
      afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.&nbsp; I’ll ask cook to bake you a
      little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
      am soon to pack your trunk.&nbsp; Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
      day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.”
      “Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.”
      “Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid of
      me.&nbsp; Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so
      provoking.”
      “I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
      have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
      dread.”
      “If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”
      “As you do, Bessie?”
      “I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
      others.”
      “You don’t show it.”
      “You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talking.&nbsp; What
      makes you so venturesome and hardy?”
      “Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say
      something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
      thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
      “And so you’re glad to leave me?”
      “Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”
      “Just now! and rather!&nbsp; How coolly my little lady says it!&nbsp; I dare say
      now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say
      you’d rather not.”
      “I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.”&nbsp; Bessie stooped; we
      mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.&nbsp;
      That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
      told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
      sweetest songs.&nbsp; Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
