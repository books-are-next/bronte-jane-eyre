CHAPTER XXI
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
yet found the key.&nbsp; I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
I have had strange ones of my own.&nbsp; Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal
comprehension.&nbsp; And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies
of Nature with man.
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
to one’s self or one’s kin.&nbsp; The saying might have worn out of my
memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served
indelibly to fix it there.&nbsp; The next day Bessie was sent for home to the
deathbed of her little sister.
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.&nbsp; It
was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it
nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the
apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven
successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
vision drew near.&nbsp; It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I
had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was
on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a
message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.&nbsp; On repairing
thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a
gentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he
held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.
“I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,” he said, rising as I entered;
“but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.”
“Oh, Robert! how do you do?&nbsp; I remember you very well: you used to give
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony.&nbsp; And how is Bessie?&nbsp;
You are married to Bessie?”
“Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
little one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and
child are thriving.”
“And are the family well at the house, Robert?”
“I am sorry I can’t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
badly at present—in great trouble.”
“I hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress.&nbsp; He too
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied—
“Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.”
“Mr. John?”
“Yes.”
“And how does his mother bear it?”
“Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways,
and his death was shocking.”
“I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.”
“Doing well!&nbsp; He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
amongst the worst men and the worst women.&nbsp; He got into debt and into
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
returned to his old companions and habits.&nbsp; His head was not strong: the
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.&nbsp; He
came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give
up all to him.&nbsp; Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by
his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he
was dead.&nbsp; How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”
I was silent: the things were frightful.&nbsp; Robert Leaven resumed—
“Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
poverty were quite breaking her down.&nbsp; The information about Mr. John’s
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.&nbsp;
She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
signs to my wife and mumbling.&nbsp; It was only yesterday morning, however,
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
her.’&nbsp; Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
advised them to send for you.&nbsp; The young ladies put it off at first; but
their mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times,
that at last they consented.&nbsp; I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
morning.”
“Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.”
“I think so too, Miss.&nbsp; Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”
“Yes; and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’
hall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the attentions
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
stables, or the grounds.&nbsp; I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes:
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.&nbsp; To the
billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices
resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and
their admirers, were all busied in the game.&nbsp; It required some courage
to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could
not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s
side.&nbsp; She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes
seemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?” and when I
said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement as if tempted
to order me away.&nbsp; I remember her appearance at the moment—it was very
graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a
gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair.&nbsp; She had been all animation
with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her
haughty lineaments.
“Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
Rochester turned to see who the “person” was.&nbsp; He made a curious
grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his
cue and followed me from the room.
“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom
door, which he had shut.
“If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”
“What to do?—where to go?”
“To see a sick lady who has sent for me.”
“What sick lady?—where does she live?”
“At Gateshead; in ---shire.”
“-shire?&nbsp; That is a hundred miles off!&nbsp; Who may she be that sends for
people to see her that distance?”
“Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.”
“Reed of Gateshead?&nbsp; There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”
“It is his widow, sir.”
“And what have you to do with her?&nbsp; How do you know her?”
“Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.”
“The deuce he was!&nbsp; You never told me that before: you always said you
had no relations.”
“None that would own me, sir.&nbsp; Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
off.”
“Why?”
“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”
“But Reed left children?—you must have cousins?&nbsp; Sir George Lynn was
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
in London.”
“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.&nbsp; The news so shocked
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.”
“And what good can you do her?&nbsp; Nonsense, Jane!&nbsp; I would never think of
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.”
“Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.”
“How long will you stay?”
“As short a time as possible, sir.”
“Promise me only to stay a week—”
“I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.”
“At all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”
“Oh, no!&nbsp; I shall certainly return if all be well.”
“And who goes with you?&nbsp; You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”
“No, sir, she has sent her coachman.”
“A person to be trusted?”
“Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.”
Mr. Rochester meditated.&nbsp; “When do you wish to go?”
“Early to-morrow morning, sir.”
“Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, and I
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.&nbsp; How much
have you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.&nbsp; “Five shillings, sir.”&nbsp; He
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
if its scantiness amused him.&nbsp; Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,”
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
fifteen.&nbsp; I told him I had no change.
“I don’t want change; you know that.&nbsp; Take your wages.”
I declined accepting more than was my due.&nbsp; He scowled at first; then,
as if recollecting something, he said—
“Right, right!&nbsp; Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
away three months if you had fifty pounds.&nbsp; There are ten; is it not
plenty?”
“Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.”
“Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.”
“Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
while I have the opportunity.”
“Matter of business?&nbsp; I am curious to hear it.”
“You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
married?”
“Yes; what then?”
“In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will
perceive the necessity of it.”
“To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her
rather too emphatically?&nbsp; There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt
of it.&nbsp; Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must
march straight to—the devil?”
“I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.”
“In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.&nbsp; He looked at me some minutes.
“And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
you to seek a place, I suppose?”
“No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me
in asking favours of them—but I shall advertise.”
“You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled.&nbsp; “At your peril
you advertise!&nbsp; I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
pounds.&nbsp; Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.”
“And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
me.&nbsp; “I could not spare the money on any account.”
“Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request!&nbsp; Give me
five pounds, Jane.”
“Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.”
“Just let me look at the cash.”
“No, sir; you are not to be trusted.”
“Jane!”
“Sir?”
“Promise me one thing.”
“I’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.”
“Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.&nbsp; I’ll
find you one in time.”
“I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that
I and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
it.”
“Very well! very well!&nbsp; I’ll pledge my word on it.&nbsp; You go to-morrow,
then?”
“Yes, sir; early.”
“Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”
“No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.”
“Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?”
“I suppose so, sir.”
“And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?&nbsp; Teach me;
I’m not quite up to it.”
“They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.”
“Then say it.”
“Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.”
“What must I say?”
“The same, if you like, sir.”
“Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?”
“Yes?”
“It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.&nbsp; I should like
something else: a little addition to the rite.&nbsp; If one shook hands, for
instance; but no—that would not content me either.&nbsp; So you’ll do no more
than say Farewell, Jane?”
“It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
as in many.”
“Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”
“How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” I asked
myself; “I want to commence my packing.”&nbsp; The dinner-bell rang, and
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.&nbsp; It
was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little
white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were
burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear.&nbsp; Bessie sat on the hearth,
nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a
corner.
“Bless you!—I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not too
late.&nbsp; How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”
“Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.&nbsp; The
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
will finally recover.”
“Has she mentioned me lately?”
“She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
house.&nbsp; She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
wakes up about six or seven.&nbsp; Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
and then I will go up with you?”
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle
and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my
bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.&nbsp; I was
glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my
travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a
child.
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling
about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and
butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert
or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former
days.&nbsp; Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot
and good looks.
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.&nbsp; I must be served at the
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with
my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me
with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled
and obeyed her as in bygone days.
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.&nbsp; I told her he was
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me
kindly, and I was content.&nbsp; Then I went on to describe to her the gay
company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details
Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she
relished.
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
bonnet, &amp;c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.&nbsp;
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
down the path I was now ascending.&nbsp; On a dark, misty, raw morning in
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.&nbsp; The same
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
and I had yet an aching heart.&nbsp; I still felt as a wanderer on the face
of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own
powers, and less withering dread of oppression.&nbsp; The gaping wound of my
wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment
extinguished.
“You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she
preceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”
In another moment I was within that apartment.&nbsp; There was every article
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first
introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still
covered the hearth.&nbsp; Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could
distinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their
old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian
Nights ranged just above.&nbsp; The inanimate objects were not changed; but
the living things had altered past recognition.
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.&nbsp; There
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of
a string of ebony beads and a crucifix.&nbsp; This I felt sure was Eliza,
though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that
elongated and colourless visage.
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.&nbsp; This was a
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and
regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.&nbsp; The
hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from
her sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as
the other’s looked puritanical.
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one;
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
the name of “Miss Eyre.”&nbsp; Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short,
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.&nbsp; Georgiana added to her “How
d’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry
side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the folds
of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my
cottage bonnet.&nbsp; Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know
that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying the words.&nbsp; A
certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of
tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing
them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the
semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor
Georgiana ruffle me.&nbsp; The fact was, I had other things to think about;
within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more
potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute
and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict
or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
“How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
liberty.
“Mrs. Reed?&nbsp; Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
can see her to-night.”
“If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
should be much obliged to you.”
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.&nbsp;
“I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”
“Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza.&nbsp; I soon
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and ask her
to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not
to-night.&nbsp; I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my
errand, I proceeded to take further measures.&nbsp; It had heretofore been my
habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I
should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next
morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a
foolish plan.&nbsp; I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt,
and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her
daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself
independent of it.&nbsp; So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me
a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two,
had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I
met Bessie on the landing.
“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and let
us see if she will know you.”
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.&nbsp; I
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood
on the table, for it was now getting dark.&nbsp; There was the great
four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the
armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been
sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.&nbsp; I
looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim
outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to
leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.&nbsp; I
approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled
pillows.
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
image.&nbsp; It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.&nbsp; I had left this woman
in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in
amity.
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
imperious, despotic eyebrow.&nbsp; How often had it lowered on me menace and
hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows
revived as I traced its harsh line now!&nbsp; And yet I stooped down and
kissed her: she looked at me.
“Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.
“Yes, Aunt Reed.&nbsp; How are you, dear aunt?”
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
sin to forget and break that vow now.&nbsp; My fingers had fastened on her
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.&nbsp; But unimpressionable
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
eradicated.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.&nbsp; Again she regarded me so
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling towards me—was
unchanged and unchangeable.&nbsp; I knew by her stony eye—opaque to
tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider me
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.&nbsp;
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
source.&nbsp; I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
the pillow.
“You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to
stay till I see how you get on.”
“Oh, of course!&nbsp; You have seen my daughters?”
“Yes.”
“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
difficulty in recalling them.&nbsp; But there was something I wished to
say—let me see—”
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
in her once vigorous frame.&nbsp; Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down:
she was at once irritated.
“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast.&nbsp; Are
you Jane Eyre?”
“I am Jane Eyre.”
“I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.&nbsp;
Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she caused
me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her
sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one’s
movements!&nbsp; I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like
a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
away from the house.&nbsp; What did they do with her at Lowood?&nbsp; The fever
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.&nbsp; She, however, did not
die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”
“A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”
“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s
disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her
death, he wept like a simpleton.&nbsp; He would send for the baby; though I
entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its
maintenance.&nbsp; I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly,
whining, pining thing!&nbsp; It would wail in its cradle all night long—not
screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.&nbsp;
Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been
his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age.&nbsp; He
would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the
darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed
their dislike.&nbsp; In his last illness, he had it brought continually to
his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep
the creature.&nbsp; I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out
of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.&nbsp; John does not at all
resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my
brothers—he is quite a Gibson.&nbsp; Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me
with letters for money?&nbsp; I have no more money to give him: we are
getting poor.&nbsp; I must send away half the servants and shut up part of
the house; or let it off.&nbsp; I can never submit to do that—yet how are we
to get on?&nbsp; Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of
mortgages.&nbsp; John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy!&nbsp; He is
beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I
feel ashamed for him when I see him.”
She was getting much excited.&nbsp; “I think I had better leave her now,”
said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
“Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night—in
the morning she is calmer.”
I rose.&nbsp; “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished
to say.&nbsp; He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death,
or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great
wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.&nbsp; I am come to
a strange pass: I have heavy troubles.&nbsp; What is to be done?&nbsp; How is the
money to be had?”
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
succeeded with difficulty.&nbsp; Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed,
and sank into a dozing state.&nbsp; I then left her.
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with
her.&nbsp; She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor
forbade everything which could painfully excite her.&nbsp; Meantime, I got on
as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.&nbsp; They were very cold,
indeed, at first.&nbsp; Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or
writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.&nbsp;
Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and
take no notice of me.&nbsp; But I was determined not to seem at a loss for
occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and
they served me for both.
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to
take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in
sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened
momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of
imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a
ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s
head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in
a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to
be, I did not care or know.&nbsp; I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
point, and worked away.&nbsp; Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with
features.&nbsp; Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that
brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight
ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means
narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of
course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on
the temples, and waved above the forehead.&nbsp; Now for the eyes: I had left
them to the last, because they required the most careful working.&nbsp; I
drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and
sombre; the irids lustrous and large.&nbsp; “Good! but not quite the thing,”
I thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;”
and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more
brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success.&nbsp; There, I had a
friend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young
ladies turned their backs on me?&nbsp; I looked at it; I smiled at the
speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.
“Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had
approached me unnoticed.&nbsp; I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.&nbsp; Of course, I lied: it was, in
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; But what was
that to her, or to any one but myself?&nbsp; Georgiana also advanced to
look.&nbsp; The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly
man.” They both seemed surprised at my skill.&nbsp; I offered to sketch their
portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.&nbsp; Then Georgiana
produced her album.&nbsp; I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing:
this put her at once into good humour.&nbsp; She proposed a walk in the
grounds.&nbsp; Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a
confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the
brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the
admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I
even got hints of the titled conquest she had made.&nbsp; In the course of
the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft
conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in
short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised
by her for my benefit.&nbsp; The communications were renewed from day to day:
they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and woes.&nbsp; It was
strange she never once adverted either to her mother’s illness, or her
brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects.&nbsp;
Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and
aspirations after dissipations to come.&nbsp; She passed about five minutes
each day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.&nbsp; I never
saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say
what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.&nbsp; She
had an alarm to call her up early.&nbsp; I know not how she occupied herself
before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.&nbsp; Three times a day she
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
Book.&nbsp; I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume,
and she said, “the Rubric.”&nbsp; Three hours she gave to stitching, with
gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough
for a carpet.&nbsp; In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article,
she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
erected near Gateshead.&nbsp; Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
her accounts.&nbsp; She seemed to want no company; no conversation.&nbsp; I
believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and
nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which
forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.&nbsp; Her own fortune she had
taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
world.&nbsp; I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
“Of course not.&nbsp; Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
had.&nbsp; She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&nbsp;
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
invitation up to town.&nbsp; “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.”&nbsp; I
did not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
funeral rites.&nbsp; Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
been before her.&nbsp; One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—
“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
allowed to cumber the earth.&nbsp; You had no right to be born, for you make
no use of life.&nbsp; Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that
you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.&nbsp; Then, too, existence for you
must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is
a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish, you
die away.&nbsp; Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?&nbsp; Take one day;
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
regularity.&nbsp; The day will close almost before you are aware it has
begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one
vacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation,
sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being
ought to do.&nbsp; Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you;
then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.&nbsp; Neglect
it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the
results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.&nbsp; I tell
you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I
am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.&nbsp; After my mother’s
death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the
vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had
never known each other.&nbsp; You need not think that because we chanced to
be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by
even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human race,
ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the
earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the
new.”
She closed her lips.
“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,”
answered Georgiana.&nbsp; “Everybody knows you are the most selfish,
heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred
towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played
me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you,
to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show
your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my
prospects for ever.”&nbsp; Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her
nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously
industrious.
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
savourless for the want of it.&nbsp; Feeling without judgment is a washy
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the
sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint’s-day
service at the new church—for in matters of religion she was a rigid
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church
thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
the room whenever she could.&nbsp; Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.&nbsp; I found
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.&nbsp; I renewed the fuel,
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze
on me, and then I moved away to the window.
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
“One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
elements.&nbsp; Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its material
tenement—flit when at length released?”
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
souls.&nbsp; I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
longing to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice
murmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?&nbsp; I went up
to her.
“It is I, Aunt Reed.”
“Who—I?” was her answer.&nbsp; “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.&nbsp; “You are quite a stranger to
me—where is Bessie?”
“She is at the lodge, aunt.”
“Aunt,” she repeated.&nbsp; “Who calls me aunt?&nbsp; You are not one of the
Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
quiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
identity.
“Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.&nbsp;
I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
besides, in eight years she must be so changed.”&nbsp; I now gently assured
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
“I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long.&nbsp; “I was trying to turn
myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.&nbsp; It is as
well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in
health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.&nbsp; Is the
nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”
I assured her we were alone.
“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.&nbsp; One was in
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
child; the other—” she stopped.&nbsp; “After all, it is of no great
importance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps,
of the last pang.
“Well, I must get it over.&nbsp; Eternity is before me: I had better tell
her.—Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
there.”
I obeyed her directions.&nbsp; “Read the letter,” she said.
It was short, and thus conceived:—
“Madam,—Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece,
Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?&nbsp; It is my intention to write
shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.&nbsp; Providence has blessed
my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and
childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my
death whatever I may have to leave.—I am, Madam, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
John Eyre, Madeira
It was dated three years back.
“Why did I never hear of this?” I asked.
“Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand
in lifting you to prosperity.&nbsp; I could not forget your conduct to me,
Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
cruelty.&nbsp; I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that
I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me
in a man’s voice.—Bring me some water!&nbsp; Oh, make haste!”
“Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
“think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.&nbsp; Forgive me
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
passed since that day.”
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
drawn breath, she went on thus—
“I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
what I could not endure.&nbsp; I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
Lowood.&nbsp; Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose
my falsehood as soon as you like.&nbsp; You were born, I think, to be my
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.”
“If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
regard me with kindness and forgiveness”
“You have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I feel
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
violence, I can never comprehend.”
“My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
vindictive.&nbsp; Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
to you now: kiss me, aunt.”
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.&nbsp; She said I
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.&nbsp; As I
laid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
“Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me—dying,
she must hate me still.
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.&nbsp; I yet lingered half-an-hour
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.&nbsp; She was
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
o’clock that night she died.&nbsp; I was not present to close her eyes, nor
were either of her daughters.&nbsp; They came to tell us the next morning
that all was over.&nbsp; She was by that time laid out.&nbsp; Eliza and I went to
look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she
dared not go.&nbsp; There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active
frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid;
her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.&nbsp;
A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me.&nbsp; I gazed on it with
gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or
hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her
woes—not my loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of
death in such a form.
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.&nbsp; After a silence of some minutes she
observed—
“With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
was shortened by trouble.”&nbsp; And then a spasm constricted her mouth for
an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did
I.&nbsp; Neither of us had dropt a tear.

      CHAPTER XXI
      Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
      signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
      yet found the key.&nbsp; I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
      I have had strange ones of my own.&nbsp; Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
      instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
      asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
      which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal
      comprehension.&nbsp; And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies
      of Nature with man.
      When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
      Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
      child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
      to one’s self or one’s kin.&nbsp; The saying might have worn out of my
      memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served
      indelibly to fix it there.&nbsp; The next day Bessie was sent for home to the
      deathbed of her little sister.
      Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
      the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
      brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
      arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
      daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.&nbsp; It
      was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it
      nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the
      apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven
      successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
      I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one
      image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
      vision drew near.&nbsp; It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I
      had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was
      on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a
      message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.&nbsp; On repairing
      thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a
      gentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he
      held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.
      “I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,” he said, rising as I entered;
      “but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
      Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.”
      “Oh, Robert! how do you do?&nbsp; I remember you very well: you used to give
      me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony.&nbsp; And how is Bessie?&nbsp;
      You are married to Bessie?”
      “Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
      little one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and
      child are thriving.”
      “And are the family well at the house, Robert?”
      “I am sorry I can’t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
      badly at present—in great trouble.”
      “I hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress.&nbsp; He too
      looked down at the crape round his hat and replied—
      “Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.”
      “Mr. John?”
      “Yes.”
      “And how does his mother bear it?”
      “Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
      very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways,
      and his death was shocking.”
      “I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.”
      “Doing well!&nbsp; He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
      amongst the worst men and the worst women.&nbsp; He got into debt and into
      jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
      returned to his old companions and habits.&nbsp; His head was not strong: the
      knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.&nbsp; He
      came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give
      up all to him.&nbsp; Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by
      his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he
      was dead.&nbsp; How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”
      I was silent: the things were frightful.&nbsp; Robert Leaven resumed—
      “Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
      stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
      poverty were quite breaking her down.&nbsp; The information about Mr. John’s
      death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.&nbsp;
      She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
      better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
      signs to my wife and mumbling.&nbsp; It was only yesterday morning, however,
      that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
      made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
      her.’&nbsp; Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
      anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
      advised them to send for you.&nbsp; The young ladies put it off at first; but
      their mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times,
      that at last they consented.&nbsp; I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
      get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
      morning.”
      “Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.”
      “I think so too, Miss.&nbsp; Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
      but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”
      “Yes; and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’
      hall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the attentions
      of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
      He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
      stables, or the grounds.&nbsp; I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes:
      she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.&nbsp; To the
      billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices
      resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and
      their admirers, were all busied in the game.&nbsp; It required some courage
      to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could
      not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s
      side.&nbsp; She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes
      seemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?” and when I
      said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement as if tempted
      to order me away.&nbsp; I remember her appearance at the moment—it was very
      graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a
      gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair.&nbsp; She had been all animation
      with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her
      haughty lineaments.
      “Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
      Rochester turned to see who the “person” was.&nbsp; He made a curious
      grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his
      cue and followed me from the room.
      “Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom
      door, which he had shut.
      “If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”
      “What to do?—where to go?”
      “To see a sick lady who has sent for me.”
      “What sick lady?—where does she live?”
      “At Gateshead; in ---shire.”
      “-shire?&nbsp; That is a hundred miles off!&nbsp; Who may she be that sends for
      people to see her that distance?”
      “Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.”
      “Reed of Gateshead?&nbsp; There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”
      “It is his widow, sir.”
      “And what have you to do with her?&nbsp; How do you know her?”
      “Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.”
      “The deuce he was!&nbsp; You never told me that before: you always said you
      had no relations.”
      “None that would own me, sir.&nbsp; Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
      off.”
      “Why?”
      “Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”
      “But Reed left children?—you must have cousins?&nbsp; Sir George Lynn was
      talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
      veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
      the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
      in London.”
      “John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
      family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.&nbsp; The news so shocked
      his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.”
      “And what good can you do her?&nbsp; Nonsense, Jane!&nbsp; I would never think of
      running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
      before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.”
      “Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
      different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.”
      “How long will you stay?”
      “As short a time as possible, sir.”
      “Promise me only to stay a week—”
      “I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.”
      “At all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any
      pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”
      “Oh, no!&nbsp; I shall certainly return if all be well.”
      “And who goes with you?&nbsp; You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”
      “No, sir, she has sent her coachman.”
      “A person to be trusted?”
      “Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.”
      Mr. Rochester meditated.&nbsp; “When do you wish to go?”
      “Early to-morrow morning, sir.”
      “Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, and I
      daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.&nbsp; How much
      have you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.
      I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.&nbsp; “Five shillings, sir.”&nbsp; He
      took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
      if its scantiness amused him.&nbsp; Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,”
      said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
      fifteen.&nbsp; I told him I had no change.
      “I don’t want change; you know that.&nbsp; Take your wages.”
      I declined accepting more than was my due.&nbsp; He scowled at first; then,
      as if recollecting something, he said—
      “Right, right!&nbsp; Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
      away three months if you had fifty pounds.&nbsp; There are ten; is it not
      plenty?”
      “Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.”
      “Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.”
      “Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
      while I have the opportunity.”
      “Matter of business?&nbsp; I am curious to hear it.”
      “You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
      married?”
      “Yes; what then?”
      “In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will
      perceive the necessity of it.”
      “To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her
      rather too emphatically?&nbsp; There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt
      of it.&nbsp; Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must
      march straight to—the devil?”
      “I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.”
      “In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
      features equally fantastic and ludicrous.&nbsp; He looked at me some minutes.
      “And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
      you to seek a place, I suppose?”
      “No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me
      in asking favours of them—but I shall advertise.”
      “You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled.&nbsp; “At your peril
      you advertise!&nbsp; I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
      pounds.&nbsp; Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.”
      “And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
      me.&nbsp; “I could not spare the money on any account.”
      “Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request!&nbsp; Give me
      five pounds, Jane.”
      “Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.”
      “Just let me look at the cash.”
      “No, sir; you are not to be trusted.”
      “Jane!”
      “Sir?”
      “Promise me one thing.”
      “I’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.”
      “Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.&nbsp; I’ll
      find you one in time.”
      “I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that
      I and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
      it.”
      “Very well! very well!&nbsp; I’ll pledge my word on it.&nbsp; You go to-morrow,
      then?”
      “Yes, sir; early.”
      “Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”
      “No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.”
      “Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?”
      “I suppose so, sir.”
      “And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?&nbsp; Teach me;
      I’m not quite up to it.”
      “They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.”
      “Then say it.”
      “Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.”
      “What must I say?”
      “The same, if you like, sir.”
      “Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?”
      “Yes?”
      “It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.&nbsp; I should like
      something else: a little addition to the rite.&nbsp; If one shook hands, for
      instance; but no—that would not content me either.&nbsp; So you’ll do no more
      than say Farewell, Jane?”
      “It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
      as in many.”
      “Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”
      “How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” I asked
      myself; “I want to commence my packing.”&nbsp; The dinner-bell rang, and
      suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
      during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
      I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of
      the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.&nbsp; It
      was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little
      white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were
      burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear.&nbsp; Bessie sat on the hearth,
      nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a
      corner.
      “Bless you!—I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
      “Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not too
      late.&nbsp; How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”
      “Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.&nbsp; The
      doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
      will finally recover.”
      “Has she mentioned me lately?”
      “She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
      but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
      house.&nbsp; She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
      wakes up about six or seven.&nbsp; Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
      and then I will go up with you?”
      Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle
      and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my
      bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.&nbsp; I was
      glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my
      travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a
      child.
      Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling
      about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and
      butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert
      or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former
      days.&nbsp; Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot
      and good looks.
      Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
      still, quite in her old peremptory tones.&nbsp; I must be served at the
      fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with
      my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me
      with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled
      and obeyed her as in bygone days.
      She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
      person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
      whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.&nbsp; I told her he was
      rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me
      kindly, and I was content.&nbsp; Then I went on to describe to her the gay
      company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details
      Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she
      relished.
      In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
      bonnet, &amp;c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.&nbsp;
      It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
      down the path I was now ascending.&nbsp; On a dark, misty, raw morning in
      January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
      heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly
      harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.&nbsp; The same
      hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
      and I had yet an aching heart.&nbsp; I still felt as a wanderer on the face
      of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own
      powers, and less withering dread of oppression.&nbsp; The gaping wound of my
      wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment
      extinguished.
      “You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she
      preceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”
      In another moment I was within that apartment.&nbsp; There was every article
      of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first
      introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still
      covered the hearth.&nbsp; Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could
      distinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their
      old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian
      Nights ranged just above.&nbsp; The inanimate objects were not changed; but
      the living things had altered past recognition.
      Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
      Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.&nbsp; There
      was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
      plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
      collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of
      a string of ebony beads and a crucifix.&nbsp; This I felt sure was Eliza,
      though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that
      elongated and colourless visage.
      The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
      remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.&nbsp; This was a
      full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and
      regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.&nbsp; The
      hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from
      her sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as
      the other’s looked puritanical.
      In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one;
      the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the
      blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
      chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
      hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
      Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
      the name of “Miss Eyre.”&nbsp; Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short,
      abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
      eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.&nbsp; Georgiana added to her “How
      d’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
      uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry
      side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the folds
      of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my
      cottage bonnet.&nbsp; Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know
      that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying the words.&nbsp; A
      certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of
      tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing
      them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.
      A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
      over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
      to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the
      semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor
      Georgiana ruffle me.&nbsp; The fact was, I had other things to think about;
      within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more
      potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute
      and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict
      or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
      “How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
      thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
      liberty.
      “Mrs. Reed?&nbsp; Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
      can see her to-night.”
      “If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
      should be much obliged to you.”
      Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.&nbsp;
      “I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not
      defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”
      “Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza.&nbsp; I soon
      rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
      just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and ask her
      to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not
      to-night.&nbsp; I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my
      errand, I proceeded to take further measures.&nbsp; It had heretofore been my
      habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I
      should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next
      morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a
      foolish plan.&nbsp; I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt,
      and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her
      daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself
      independent of it.&nbsp; So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me
      a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two,
      had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I
      met Bessie on the landing.
      “Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and let
      us see if she will know you.”
      I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
      often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.&nbsp; I
      hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood
      on the table, for it was now getting dark.&nbsp; There was the great
      four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the
      armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been
      sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.&nbsp; I
      looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim
      outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to
      leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.&nbsp; I
      approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled
      pillows.
      Well did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
      image.&nbsp; It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
      and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.&nbsp; I had left this woman
      in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
      than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
      forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in
      amity.
      The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that
      peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
      imperious, despotic eyebrow.&nbsp; How often had it lowered on me menace and
      hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows
      revived as I traced its harsh line now!&nbsp; And yet I stooped down and
      kissed her: she looked at me.
      “Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.
      “Yes, Aunt Reed.&nbsp; How are you, dear aunt?”
      I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
      sin to forget and break that vow now.&nbsp; My fingers had fastened on her
      hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
      at that moment have experienced true pleasure.&nbsp; But unimpressionable
      natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
      eradicated.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
      from me, she remarked that the night was warm.&nbsp; Again she regarded me so
      icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling towards me—was
      unchanged and unchangeable.&nbsp; I knew by her stony eye—opaque to
      tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider me
      bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
      pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
      I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
      subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.&nbsp;
      My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
      source.&nbsp; I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
      the pillow.
      “You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to
      stay till I see how you get on.”
      “Oh, of course!&nbsp; You have seen my daughters?”
      “Yes.”
      “Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
      over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
      difficulty in recalling them.&nbsp; But there was something I wished to
      say—let me see—”
      The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
      in her once vigorous frame.&nbsp; Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
      round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down:
      she was at once irritated.
      “Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast.&nbsp; Are
      you Jane Eyre?”
      “I am Jane Eyre.”
      “I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.&nbsp;
      Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she caused
      me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her
      sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one’s
      movements!&nbsp; I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like
      a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
      away from the house.&nbsp; What did they do with her at Lowood?&nbsp; The fever
      broke out there, and many of the pupils died.&nbsp; She, however, did not
      die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”
      “A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”
      “I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only
      sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s
      disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her
      death, he wept like a simpleton.&nbsp; He would send for the baby; though I
      entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its
      maintenance.&nbsp; I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly,
      whining, pining thing!&nbsp; It would wail in its cradle all night long—not
      screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.&nbsp;
      Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been
      his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age.&nbsp; He
      would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the
      darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed
      their dislike.&nbsp; In his last illness, he had it brought continually to
      his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep
      the creature.&nbsp; I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out
      of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.&nbsp; John does not at all
      resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my
      brothers—he is quite a Gibson.&nbsp; Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me
      with letters for money?&nbsp; I have no more money to give him: we are
      getting poor.&nbsp; I must send away half the servants and shut up part of
      the house; or let it off.&nbsp; I can never submit to do that—yet how are we
      to get on?&nbsp; Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of
      mortgages.&nbsp; John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy!&nbsp; He is
      beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I
      feel ashamed for him when I see him.”
      She was getting much excited.&nbsp; “I think I had better leave her now,”
      said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
      “Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night—in
      the morning she is calmer.”
      I rose.&nbsp; “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished
      to say.&nbsp; He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death,
      or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great
      wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.&nbsp; I am come to
      a strange pass: I have heavy troubles.&nbsp; What is to be done?&nbsp; How is the
      money to be had?”
      Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
      succeeded with difficulty.&nbsp; Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed,
      and sank into a dozing state.&nbsp; I then left her.
      More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with
      her.&nbsp; She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor
      forbade everything which could painfully excite her.&nbsp; Meantime, I got on
      as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.&nbsp; They were very cold,
      indeed, at first.&nbsp; Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or
      writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.&nbsp;
      Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and
      take no notice of me.&nbsp; But I was determined not to seem at a loss for
      occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and
      they served me for both.
      Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to
      take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in
      sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened
      momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of
      imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a
      ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s
      head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in
      a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
      One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to
      be, I did not care or know.&nbsp; I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
      point, and worked away.&nbsp; Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
      prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
      gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with
      features.&nbsp; Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that
      brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight
      ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means
      narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of
      course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on
      the temples, and waved above the forehead.&nbsp; Now for the eyes: I had left
      them to the last, because they required the most careful working.&nbsp; I
      drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and
      sombre; the irids lustrous and large.&nbsp; “Good! but not quite the thing,”
      I thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;”
      and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more
      brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success.&nbsp; There, I had a
      friend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young
      ladies turned their backs on me?&nbsp; I looked at it; I smiled at the
      speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.
      “Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had
      approached me unnoticed.&nbsp; I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
      and hurried it beneath the other sheets.&nbsp; Of course, I lied: it was, in
      fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; But what was
      that to her, or to any one but myself?&nbsp; Georgiana also advanced to
      look.&nbsp; The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly
      man.” They both seemed surprised at my skill.&nbsp; I offered to sketch their
      portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.&nbsp; Then Georgiana
      produced her album.&nbsp; I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing:
      this put her at once into good humour.&nbsp; She proposed a walk in the
      grounds.&nbsp; Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a
      confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the
      brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the
      admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I
      even got hints of the titled conquest she had made.&nbsp; In the course of
      the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft
      conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in
      short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised
      by her for my benefit.&nbsp; The communications were renewed from day to day:
      they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and woes.&nbsp; It was
      strange she never once adverted either to her mother’s illness, or her
      brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects.&nbsp;
      Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and
      aspirations after dissipations to come.&nbsp; She passed about five minutes
      each day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.
      Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.&nbsp; I never
      saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say
      what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.&nbsp; She
      had an alarm to call her up early.&nbsp; I know not how she occupied herself
      before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
      portions, and each hour had its allotted task.&nbsp; Three times a day she
      studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
      Book.&nbsp; I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume,
      and she said, “the Rubric.”&nbsp; Three hours she gave to stitching, with
      gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough
      for a carpet.&nbsp; In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article,
      she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
      erected near Gateshead.&nbsp; Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
      working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
      her accounts.&nbsp; She seemed to want no company; no conversation.&nbsp; I
      believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and
      nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which
      forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.
      She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
      usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
      been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
      settled her mind, and formed her resolution.&nbsp; Her own fortune she had
      taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly
      improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
      linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
      retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
      disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
      world.&nbsp; I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
      “Of course not.&nbsp; Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
      had.&nbsp; She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&nbsp;
      Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”
      Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
      in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
      wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
      invitation up to town.&nbsp; “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she
      could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.”&nbsp; I
      did not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she
      referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
      funeral rites.&nbsp; Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s
      indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
      been before her.&nbsp; One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
      unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—
      “Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
      allowed to cumber the earth.&nbsp; You had no right to be born, for you make
      no use of life.&nbsp; Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
      reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
      other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
      himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that
      you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.&nbsp; Then, too, existence for you
      must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is
      a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
      flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish, you
      die away.&nbsp; Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
      independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?&nbsp; Take one day;
      share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
      stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include
      all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
      regularity.&nbsp; The day will close almost before you are aware it has
      begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one
      vacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation,
      sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being
      ought to do.&nbsp; Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you;
      then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.&nbsp; Neglect
      it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the
      results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.&nbsp; I tell
      you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I
      am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.&nbsp; After my mother’s
      death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the
      vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had
      never known each other.&nbsp; You need not think that because we chanced to
      be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by
      even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human race,
      ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the
      earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the
      new.”
      She closed her lips.
      “You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,”
      answered Georgiana.&nbsp; “Everybody knows you are the most selfish,
      heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred
      towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played
      me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you,
      to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show
      your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my
      prospects for ever.”&nbsp; Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her
      nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously
      industrious.
      True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
      two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
      savourless for the want of it.&nbsp; Feeling without judgment is a washy
      draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
      husky a morsel for human deglutition.
      It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the
      sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint’s-day
      service at the new church—for in matters of religion she was a rigid
      formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
      considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church
      thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
      I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
      lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
      attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
      the room whenever she could.&nbsp; Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
      family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.&nbsp; I found
      the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
      patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
      pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.&nbsp; I renewed the fuel,
      re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze
      on me, and then I moved away to the window.
      The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
      “One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
      elements.&nbsp; Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its material
      tenement—flit when at length released?”
      In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
      dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
      souls.&nbsp; I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
      tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
      sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
      longing to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice
      murmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”
      I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?&nbsp; I went up
      to her.
      “It is I, Aunt Reed.”
      “Who—I?” was her answer.&nbsp; “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and
      a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.&nbsp; “You are quite a stranger to
      me—where is Bessie?”
      “She is at the lodge, aunt.”
      “Aunt,” she repeated.&nbsp; “Who calls me aunt?&nbsp; You are not one of the
      Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
      quiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”
      I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
      identity.
      “Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.&nbsp;
      I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
      besides, in eight years she must be so changed.”&nbsp; I now gently assured
      her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
      that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
      explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
      “I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long.&nbsp; “I was trying to turn
      myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.&nbsp; It is as
      well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in
      health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.&nbsp; Is the
      nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”
      I assured her we were alone.
      “Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.&nbsp; One was in
      breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
      child; the other—” she stopped.&nbsp; “After all, it is of no great
      importance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get
      better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”
      She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
      she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps,
      of the last pang.
      “Well, I must get it over.&nbsp; Eternity is before me: I had better tell
      her.—Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
      there.”
      I obeyed her directions.&nbsp; “Read the letter,” she said.
      It was short, and thus conceived:—
      “Madam,—Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece,
      Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?&nbsp; It is my intention to write
      shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.&nbsp; Providence has blessed
      my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and
      childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my
      death whatever I may have to leave.—I am, Madam, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
      John Eyre, Madeira
      It was dated three years back.
      “Why did I never hear of this?” I asked.
      “Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand
      in lifting you to prosperity.&nbsp; I could not forget your conduct to me,
      Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
      declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
      unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
      of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
      cruelty.&nbsp; I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
      and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that
      I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me
      in a man’s voice.—Bring me some water!&nbsp; Oh, make haste!”
      “Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
      “think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.&nbsp; Forgive me
      for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
      passed since that day.”
      She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
      drawn breath, she went on thus—
      “I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
      adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
      what I could not endure.&nbsp; I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
      disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
      Lowood.&nbsp; Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose
      my falsehood as soon as you like.&nbsp; You were born, I think, to be my
      torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
      for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.”
      “If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
      regard me with kindness and forgiveness”
      “You have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I feel
      it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
      quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
      violence, I can never comprehend.”
      “My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
      vindictive.&nbsp; Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
      love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
      to you now: kiss me, aunt.”
      I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.&nbsp; She said I
      oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.&nbsp; As I
      laid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
      drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
      fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
      “Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my
      full and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”
      Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
      change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me—dying,
      she must hate me still.
      The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.&nbsp; I yet lingered half-an-hour
      longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.&nbsp; She was
      fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
      o’clock that night she died.&nbsp; I was not present to close her eyes, nor
      were either of her daughters.&nbsp; They came to tell us the next morning
      that all was over.&nbsp; She was by that time laid out.&nbsp; Eliza and I went to
      look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she
      dared not go.&nbsp; There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active
      frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid;
      her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.&nbsp;
      A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me.&nbsp; I gazed on it with
      gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or
      hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her
      woes—not my loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of
      death in such a form.
      Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.&nbsp; After a silence of some minutes she
      observed—
      “With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
      was shortened by trouble.”&nbsp; And then a spasm constricted her mouth for
      an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did
      I.&nbsp; Neither of us had dropt a tear.
