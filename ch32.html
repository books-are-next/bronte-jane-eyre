CHAPTER XXX
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.&nbsp;
In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all
day, and walk out sometimes.&nbsp; I could join with Diana and Mary in all
their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid
them when and where they would allow me.&nbsp; There was a reviving pleasure
in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the
pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and
principles.
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted
me; what they approved, I reverenced.&nbsp; They loved their sequestered
home.&nbsp; I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof,
its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged
firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden,
dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest species
would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent.&nbsp; They clung to the
purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale into
which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and
which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the
wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,
or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little
mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect
enthusiasm of attachment.&nbsp; I could comprehend the feeling, and share
both its strength and truth.&nbsp; I saw the fascination of the locality.&nbsp; I
felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline
of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell
by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag.&nbsp; These details were just to me what they were
to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.&nbsp; The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise
and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in
these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my faculties
the same spell that entranced theirs.
Indoors we agreed equally well.&nbsp; They were both more accomplished and
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
knowledge they had trodden before me.&nbsp; I devoured the books they lent
me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening
what I had perused during the day.&nbsp; Thought fitted thought; opinion met
opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.&nbsp;
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.&nbsp; In
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.&nbsp; I could
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s feet, to rest
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.&nbsp; Diana offered
to teach me German.&nbsp; I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
me no less.&nbsp; Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection—of the strongest
kind—was the result.&nbsp; They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.&nbsp; My skill, greater in this
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.&nbsp; Mary would sit and
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a
docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.&nbsp; Thus occupied, and
mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and
rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him.&nbsp; One reason of
the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively
seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to
visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
and, followed by his father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.&nbsp;
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
expostulate.&nbsp; He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
cheerful—
“And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
propose to myself?”
Diana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
a brooding nature.&nbsp; Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
Christian and practical philanthropist.&nbsp; Often, of an evening, when he
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease
reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to
I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and
exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of
his eye.
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight
it was to his sisters.&nbsp; He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of
their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the thousand
peaceful delights they could yield.
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
of gauging his mind.&nbsp; I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard
him preach in his own church at Morton.&nbsp; I wish I could describe that
sermon: but it is past my power.&nbsp; I cannot even render faithfully the
effect it produced on me.
It began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous
language.&nbsp; This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled.&nbsp; The
heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher:
neither were softened.&nbsp; Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an
absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.&nbsp;
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to which I
had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
disquieting aspirations.&nbsp; I was sure St. John Rivers—pure-lived,
conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found that peace of God
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought,
than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and
lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but
which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
Meantime a month was gone.&nbsp; Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor
House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited
them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,
where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty
members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither
knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their
acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or
the taste of their waiting-woman.&nbsp; Mr. St. John had said nothing to me
yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became
urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind.&nbsp; One morning, being
left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach
the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind
of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times difficult to break the
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his—when he saved me the
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
Looking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.
“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
myself to undertake?”
“I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become attached
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed it
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”
“And they will go in three days now?” I said.
“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:
Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.&nbsp; I was obliged to
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
interest to me.
“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?&nbsp; I hope this delay
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”
“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
you to accept.”
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.&nbsp; I grew
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as
words could have done, and with less trouble.
“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.&nbsp; Before I explain,
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,
it must be as the blind man would help the lame.&nbsp; I am poor; for I find
that, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and
the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in
front.&nbsp; I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole
descendants of the race, two earn the dependant’s crust among strangers,
and the third considers himself an alien from his native country—not
only for life, but in death.&nbsp; Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem,
himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the
cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders,
and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he
is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
glance.&nbsp; He resumed—
“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service
of poverty and obscurity.&nbsp; You may even think it degrading—for I see
now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean
to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated;
but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race.&nbsp; I
hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the meed his
toil brings—the higher the honour.&nbsp; His, under such circumstances, is
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were
the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.”
“Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.&nbsp; The
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
succeeding observations.
“I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”
“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.
“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how
cramping.&nbsp; I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
and that I am my own master.&nbsp; I shall leave the place probably in the
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to
the utmost for its improvement.&nbsp; Morton, when I came to it two years
ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every
hope of progress.&nbsp; I established one for boys: I mean now to open a
second school for girls.&nbsp; I have hired a building for the purpose, with
a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house.&nbsp; Her
salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,
very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;
the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the
proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley.&nbsp; The same
lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the
workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial
offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of
teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.&nbsp; Will you
be this mistress?”
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
what light the lot would appear to me.&nbsp; In truth it was humble—but then
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but then,
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I made my decision.
“I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
heart.”
“But you comprehend me?” he said.&nbsp; “It is a village school: your
scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best,
farmers’ daughters.&nbsp; Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will
be all you will have to teach.&nbsp; What will you do with your
accomplishments?&nbsp; What, with the largest portion of your
mind—sentiments—tastes?”
“Save them till they are wanted.&nbsp; They will keep.”
“You know what you undertake, then?”
“I do.”
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
deeply gratified.
“And when will you commence the exercise of your function?”
“I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
week.”
“Very well: so be it.”
He rose and walked through the room.&nbsp; Standing still, he again looked at
me.&nbsp; He shook his head.
“What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?” I asked.
“You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!”
“Why?&nbsp; What is your reason for saying so?”
“I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
maintenance of an even tenor in life.”
“I am not ambitious.”
He started at the word “ambitious.”&nbsp; He repeated, “No.&nbsp; What made you
think of ambition?&nbsp; Who is ambitious?&nbsp; I know I am: but how did you find
it out?”
“I was speaking of myself.”
“Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—”&nbsp; He paused.
“What?”
“I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.&nbsp; I mean, that human
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.&nbsp; I am sure
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of
stimulus: any more than I can be content,” he added, with emphasis, “to
live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God
gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made
useless.&nbsp; You hear now how I contradict myself.&nbsp; I, who preached
contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers
of wood and drawers of water in God’s service—I, His ordained minister,
almost rave in my restlessness.&nbsp; Well, propensities and principles must
be reconciled by some means.”
He left the room.&nbsp; In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
for leaving their brother and their home.&nbsp; They both tried to appear as
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could
not be entirely conquered or concealed.&nbsp; Diana intimated that this would
be a different parting from any they had ever yet known.&nbsp; It would
probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it
might be a parting for life.
“He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,” she said: “natural
affection and feelings more potent still.&nbsp; St. John looks quiet, Jane;
but he hides a fever in his vitals.&nbsp; You would think him gentle, yet in
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.&nbsp; It is
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!”&nbsp; And the tears gushed
to her fine eyes.&nbsp; Mary bent her head low over her work.
“We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,”
she murmured.
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by
fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that “misfortunes never
come singly,” and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
between the cup and the lip.&nbsp; St. John passed the window reading a
letter.&nbsp; He entered.
“Our uncle John is dead,” said he.
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
“Dead?” repeated Diana.
“Yes.”
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother’s face.&nbsp; “And what then?”
she demanded, in a low voice.
“What then, Die?” he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of
feature.&nbsp; “What then?&nbsp; Why—nothing.&nbsp; Read.”
He threw the letter into her lap.&nbsp; She glanced over it, and handed it to
Mary.&nbsp; Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.&nbsp; All
three looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive smile
enough.
“Amen!&nbsp; We can yet live,” said Diana at last.
“At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,” remarked
Mary.
“Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might
have been,” said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts it somewhat too vividly
with what is.”
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
For some minutes no one spoke.&nbsp; Diana then turned to me.
“Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,” she said, “and think us
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.&nbsp; He was
my mother’s brother.&nbsp; My father and he quarrelled long ago.&nbsp; It was by
his advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation
that ruined him.&nbsp; Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted
in anger, and were never reconciled.&nbsp; My uncle engaged afterwards in
more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
thousand pounds.&nbsp; He was never married, and had no near kindred but
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.&nbsp; My
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
for the purchase of three mourning rings.&nbsp; He had a right, of course, to
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
receipt of such news.&nbsp; Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich
with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do.”
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further
reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.&nbsp; The next day
I left Marsh End for Morton.&nbsp; The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it
for distant B-.&nbsp; In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the
parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.

      which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
      Meantime a month was gone.&nbsp; Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor
      House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited
      them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,
      where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty
      members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither
      knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their
      acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or
      the taste of their waiting-woman.&nbsp; Mr. St. John had said nothing to me
      yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became
      urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind.&nbsp; One morning, being
      left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach
      the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind
      of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
      words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times difficult to break the
      ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his—when he saved me the
      trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
      Looking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.
      “Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
      myself to undertake?”
      “I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
      both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become attached
      to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed it
      inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
      departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”
      “And they will go in three days now?” I said.
      “Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:
      Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”
      I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
      broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
      look denoted abstraction from me and my business.&nbsp; I was obliged to
      recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
      interest to me.
      “What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?&nbsp; I hope this delay
      will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”
      “Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
      you to accept.”
      He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.&nbsp; I grew
      impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
      fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as
      words could have done, and with less trouble.
      “You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I
      have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.&nbsp; Before I explain,
      recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,
      it must be as the blind man would help the lame.&nbsp; I am poor; for I find
      that, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to
      me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and
      the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in
      front.&nbsp; I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole
      descendants of the race, two earn the dependant’s crust among strangers,
      and the third considers himself an alien from his native country—not
      only for life, but in death.&nbsp; Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem,
      himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the
      cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders,
      and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he
      is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”
      St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
      deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
      glance.&nbsp; He resumed—
      “And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service
      of poverty and obscurity.&nbsp; You may even think it degrading—for I see
      now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean
      to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated;
      but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race.&nbsp; I
      hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
      labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the meed his
      toil brings—the higher the honour.&nbsp; His, under such circumstances, is
      the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were
      the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.”
      “Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”
      He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
      my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.&nbsp; The
      conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
      succeeding observations.
      “I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it
      for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
      keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English
      country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
      repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”
      “Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.
      “I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how
      cramping.&nbsp; I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
      and that I am my own master.&nbsp; I shall leave the place probably in the
      course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to
      the utmost for its improvement.&nbsp; Morton, when I came to it two years
      ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every
      hope of progress.&nbsp; I established one for boys: I mean now to open a
      second school for girls.&nbsp; I have hired a building for the purpose, with
      a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house.&nbsp; Her
      salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,
      very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;
      the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the
      proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley.&nbsp; The same
      lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the
      workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial
      offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of
      teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.&nbsp; Will you
      be this mistress?”
      He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
      indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
      all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
      what light the lot would appear to me.&nbsp; In truth it was humble—but then
      it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but then,
      compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
      and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
      was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I made my decision.
      “I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
      heart.”
      “But you comprehend me?” he said.&nbsp; “It is a village school: your
      scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best,
      farmers’ daughters.&nbsp; Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will
      be all you will have to teach.&nbsp; What will you do with your
      accomplishments?&nbsp; What, with the largest portion of your
      mind—sentiments—tastes?”
      “Save them till they are wanted.&nbsp; They will keep.”
      “You know what you undertake, then?”
      “I do.”
      He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
      deeply gratified.
      “And when will you commence the exercise of your function?”
      “I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
      week.”
      “Very well: so be it.”
      He rose and walked through the room.&nbsp; Standing still, he again looked at
      me.&nbsp; He shook his head.
      “What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?” I asked.
      “You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!”
      “Why?&nbsp; What is your reason for saying so?”
      “I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
      maintenance of an even tenor in life.”
      “I am not ambitious.”
      He started at the word “ambitious.”&nbsp; He repeated, “No.&nbsp; What made you
      think of ambition?&nbsp; Who is ambitious?&nbsp; I know I am: but how did you find
      it out?”
      “I was speaking of myself.”
      “Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—”&nbsp; He paused.
      “What?”
      “I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
      misunderstood the word, and been displeased.&nbsp; I mean, that human
      affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.&nbsp; I am sure
      you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
      devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of
      stimulus: any more than I can be content,” he added, with emphasis, “to
      live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God
      gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made
      useless.&nbsp; You hear now how I contradict myself.&nbsp; I, who preached
      contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers
      of wood and drawers of water in God’s service—I, His ordained minister,
      almost rave in my restlessness.&nbsp; Well, propensities and principles must
      be reconciled by some means.”
      He left the room.&nbsp; In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
      the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
      Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
      for leaving their brother and their home.&nbsp; They both tried to appear as
      usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could
      not be entirely conquered or concealed.&nbsp; Diana intimated that this would
      be a different parting from any they had ever yet known.&nbsp; It would
      probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it
      might be a parting for life.
      “He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,” she said: “natural
      affection and feelings more potent still.&nbsp; St. John looks quiet, Jane;
      but he hides a fever in his vitals.&nbsp; You would think him gentle, yet in
      some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
      conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
      decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.&nbsp; It is
      right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!”&nbsp; And the tears gushed
      to her fine eyes.&nbsp; Mary bent her head low over her work.
      “We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,”
      she murmured.
      At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by
      fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that “misfortunes never
      come singly,” and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
      between the cup and the lip.&nbsp; St. John passed the window reading a
      letter.&nbsp; He entered.
      “Our uncle John is dead,” said he.
      Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
      appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
      “Dead?” repeated Diana.
      “Yes.”
      She riveted a searching gaze on her brother’s face.&nbsp; “And what then?”
      she demanded, in a low voice.
      “What then, Die?” he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of
      feature.&nbsp; “What then?&nbsp; Why—nothing.&nbsp; Read.”
      He threw the letter into her lap.&nbsp; She glanced over it, and handed it to
      Mary.&nbsp; Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.&nbsp; All
      three looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive smile
      enough.
      “Amen!&nbsp; We can yet live,” said Diana at last.
      “At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,” remarked
      Mary.
      “Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might
      have been,” said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts it somewhat too vividly
      with what is.”
      He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
      For some minutes no one spoke.&nbsp; Diana then turned to me.
      “Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,” she said, “and think us
      hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
      relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.&nbsp; He was
      my mother’s brother.&nbsp; My father and he quarrelled long ago.&nbsp; It was by
      his advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation
      that ruined him.&nbsp; Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted
      in anger, and were never reconciled.&nbsp; My uncle engaged afterwards in
      more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
      thousand pounds.&nbsp; He was never married, and had no near kindred but
      ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.&nbsp; My
      father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
      leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
      bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
      thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
      for the purchase of three mourning rings.&nbsp; He had a right, of course, to
      do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
      receipt of such news.&nbsp; Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich
      with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
      valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do.”
      This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further
      reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.&nbsp; The next day
      I left Marsh End for Morton.&nbsp; The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it
      for distant B-.&nbsp; In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the
      parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.
