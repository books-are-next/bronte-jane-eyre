Jeannette,” with a&nbsp;kiss I&nbsp;set out.</span></p>

          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="13" data-nb-words="103" data-nb-chars="556"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="103" data-nb-chars="556">On&nbsp;the hill-top above me&nbsp;sat the rising moon; pale yet as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in&nbsp;trees, sent up&nbsp;a&nbsp;blue smoke from its few chimneys: it&nbsp;was yet a&nbsp;mile distant, but in&nbsp;the absolute hush I&nbsp;could hear plainly its thin murmurs of&nbsp;life.&nbsp; My&nbsp;ear, too, felt the flow of&nbsp;currents; in&nbsp;what dales and depths I&nbsp;could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes.&nbsp; That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of&nbsp;the nearest streams, the sough of&nbsp;the most remote.</span></p>
