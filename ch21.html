CHAPTER XIX
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl—if
Sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the
chimney-corner.&nbsp; She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a
broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her
chin.&nbsp; An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over
the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book,
by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most
old women do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my
entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.&nbsp; I felt now as
composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the
gipsy’s appearance to trouble one’s calm.&nbsp; She shut her book and slowly
looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as
she raised it, that it was a strange one.&nbsp; It looked all brown and
black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed
under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye
confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.
“Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as decided
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
“I don’t care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
warn you, I have no faith.”
“It’s like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
your step as you crossed the threshold.”
“Did you?&nbsp; You’ve a quick ear.”
“I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.”
“You need them all in your trade.”
“I do; especially when I’ve customers like you to deal with.&nbsp; Why don’t
you tremble?”
“I’m not cold.”
“Why don’t you turn pale?”
“I am not sick.”
“Why don’t you consult my art?”
“I’m not silly.”
The old crone “nichered” a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.&nbsp; Having
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
deliberately—“You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.”
“Prove it,” I rejoined.
“I will, in few words.&nbsp; You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
strikes the fire from you that is in you.&nbsp; You are sick; because the
best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far
away from you.&nbsp; You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not
beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it
waits you.”
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
with vigour.
“You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
solitary dependent in a great house.”
“I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
one?”
“In my circumstances.”
“Yes; just so, in your circumstances: but find me another precisely
placed as you are.”
“It would be easy to find you thousands.”
“You could scarcely find me one.&nbsp; If you knew it, you are peculiarly
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.&nbsp; The materials
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.&nbsp; Chance
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss
results.”
“I don’t understand enigmas.&nbsp; I never could guess a riddle in my life.”
“If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.”
“And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?”
“To be sure.”
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
told me to hold out my hand.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; She approached her face to the
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
“It is too fine,” said she.&nbsp; “I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?&nbsp; Destiny is not
written there.”
“I believe you,” said I.
“No,” she continued, “it is in the face: on the forehead, about the
eyes, in the lines of the mouth.&nbsp; Kneel, and lift up your head.”
“Ah! now you are coming to reality,” I said, as I obeyed her.&nbsp; “I shall
begin to put some faith in you presently.”
I knelt within half a yard of her.&nbsp; She stirred the fire, so that a
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as
she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
“I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,” she said, when
she had examined me a while.&nbsp; “I wonder what thoughts are busy in your
heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people
flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little
sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were
really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.”
“I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.”
“Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
whispers of the future?”
“Not I.&nbsp; The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings
to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself.”
“A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that
window-seat (you see I know your habits )—”
“You have learned them from the servants.”
“Ah! you think yourself sharp.&nbsp; Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole—”
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
“You have—have you?” thought I; “there is diablerie in the business
after all, then!”
“Don’t be alarmed,” continued the strange being; “she’s a safe hand is
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.&nbsp; But,
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing
but your future school?&nbsp; Have you no present interest in any of the
company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?&nbsp; Is there not one
face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least
curiosity?”
“I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.”
“But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?”
“I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
tale: it amuses me to watch them.”
“What tale do you like best to hear?”
“Oh, I have not much choice!&nbsp; They generally run on the same
theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.”
“And do you like that monotonous theme?”
“Positively, I don’t care about it: it is nothing to me.”
“Nothing to you?&nbsp; When a lady, young and full of life and health,
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,
sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”
“I what?”
“You know—and perhaps think well of.”
“I don’t know the gentlemen here.&nbsp; I have scarcely interchanged a
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.”
“You don’t know the gentlemen here?&nbsp; You have not exchanged a syllable
with one of them?&nbsp; Will you say that of the master of the house!”
“He is not at home.”
“A profound remark!&nbsp; A most ingenious quibble!&nbsp; He went to Millcote this
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him, as
it were, out of existence?”
“No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
you had introduced.”
“I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late
so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester’s eyes that they
overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked
that?”
“Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.”
“No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured
with the most lively and the most continuous?”
“The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.”&nbsp; I said
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.&nbsp; One unexpected
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every
pulse.
“Eagerness of a listener!” repeated she: “yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such
delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing
to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
noticed this?”
“Grateful!&nbsp; I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.”
“Detecting!&nbsp; You have analysed, then.&nbsp; And what did you detect, if not
gratitude?”
I said nothing.
“You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen
him married, and beheld his bride happy?”
“Humph!&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; Your witch’s skill is rather at fault sometimes.”
“What the devil have you seen, then?”
“Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.&nbsp; Is it known that
Mr. Rochester is to be married?”
“Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.”
“Shortly?”
“Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
they will be a superlatively happy pair.&nbsp; He must love such a handsome,
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
his person, at least his purse.&nbsp; I know she considers the Rochester
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.&nbsp; I would advise her
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
clearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—”
“But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune: I came to
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.”
“Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
contradicted another.&nbsp; Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
I know.&nbsp; I knew it before I came here this evening.&nbsp; She has laid it
carefully on one side for you.&nbsp; I saw her do it.&nbsp; It depends on yourself
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
the problem I study.&nbsp; Kneel again on the rug.”
“Don’t keep me long; the fire scorches me.”
I knelt.&nbsp; She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
her chair.&nbsp; She began muttering,—
“The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.&nbsp; It turns from me; it
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,—to disown the charge
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me
in my opinion.&nbsp; The eye is favourable.
“As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
on much the heart experiences.&nbsp; Mobile and flexible, it was never
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
for its interlocutor.&nbsp; That feature too is propitious.
“I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
professes to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
require me so to do.&nbsp; I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.&nbsp; I have an
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
to give.’&nbsp; The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
chasms.&nbsp; The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote
in every decision.&nbsp; Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:
but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which
interprets the dictates of conscience.’
“Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.&nbsp; I have
formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to
the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.&nbsp; I know how soon youth
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not
want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste.&nbsp; I wish to
foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood—no,
nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in
sweet—That will do.&nbsp; I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.&nbsp; I
should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare
not.&nbsp; So far I have governed myself thoroughly.&nbsp; I have acted as I
inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my
strength.&nbsp; Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out’.”
Where was I?&nbsp; Did I wake or sleep?&nbsp; Had I been dreaming?&nbsp; Did I dream
still?&nbsp; The old woman’s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my
own tongue.&nbsp; I got up, but did not go.&nbsp; I looked; I stirred the fire,
and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about
her face, and again beckoned me to depart.&nbsp; The flame illuminated her
hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at
once noticed that hand.&nbsp; It was no more the withered limb of eld than my
own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.&nbsp; Again
I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me—on the
contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head
advanced.
“Well, Jane, do you know me?” asked the familiar voice.
“Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—”
“But the string is in a knot—help me.”
“Break it, sir.”
“There, then—‘Off, ye lendings!’”&nbsp; And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
disguise.
“Now, sir, what a strange idea!”
“But well carried out, eh?&nbsp; Don’t you think so?”
“With the ladies you must have managed well.”
“But not with you?”
“You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.”
“What character did I act?&nbsp; My own?”
“No; some unaccountable one.&nbsp; In short, I believe you have been trying
to draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
nonsense.&nbsp; It is scarcely fair, sir.”
“Do you forgive me, Jane?”
“I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.&nbsp; If, on reflection, I
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
but it was not right.”
“Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.”
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.&nbsp; It was a comfort; but,
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
interview.&nbsp; Something of masquerade I suspected.&nbsp; I knew gipsies and
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
conceal her features.&nbsp; But my mind had been running on Grace Poole—that
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.&nbsp; I had
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
“Well,” said he, “what are you musing about?&nbsp; What does that grave smile
signify?”
“Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.&nbsp; I have your permission to retire
now, I suppose?”
“No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
yonder are doing.”
“Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.”
“Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me.”
“I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o’clock.&nbsp; Oh,
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
left this morning?”
“A stranger!—no; who can it be?&nbsp; I expected no one; is he gone?”
“No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty
of installing himself here till you returned.”
“The devil he did!&nbsp; Did he give his name?”
“His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
Town, in Jamaica, I think.”
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
me to a chair.&nbsp; As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
“Mason!—the West Indies!” he said, in the tone one might fancy a
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; “Mason!—the West
Indies!” he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
seemed to know what he was doing.
“Do you feel ill, sir?” I inquired.
“Jane, I’ve got a blow; I’ve got a blow, Jane!”&nbsp; He staggered.
“Oh, lean on me, sir.”
“Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.”
“Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.”
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.&nbsp; Holding my hand in both his
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most
troubled and dreary look.
“My little friend!” said he, “I wish I were in a quiet island with only
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from
me.”
“Can I help you, sir?—I’d give my life to serve you.”
“Jane, if aid is wanted, I’ll seek it at your hands; I promise you
that.”
“Thank you, sir.&nbsp; Tell me what to do,—I’ll try, at least, to do it.”
“Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
doing.”
I went.&nbsp; I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,—the supper was
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their
hands.&nbsp; Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were
general and animated.&nbsp; Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel
and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.&nbsp; I filled a
wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she
thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the
library.
Mr. Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
firm and stern.&nbsp; He took the glass from my hand.
“Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!” he said.&nbsp; He swallowed the
contents and returned it to me.&nbsp; “What are they doing, Jane?”
“Laughing and talking, sir.”
“They don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
strange?”
“Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.”
“And Mason?”
“He was laughing too.”
“If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
Jane?”
“Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.”
He half smiled.&nbsp; “But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at
me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped
off and left me one by one, what then?&nbsp; Would you go with them?”
“I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
you.”
“To comfort me?”
“Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.”
“And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?”
“I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I
should care nothing about it.”
“Then, you could dare censure for my sake?”
“I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence;
as you, I am sure, do.”
“Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
and then leave me.”
“Yes, sir.”
I did his behest.&nbsp; The company all stared at me as I passed straight
among them.&nbsp; I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester’s voice, and
heard him say, “This way, Mason; this is your room.”
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.&nbsp; I was soon
asleep.

      “I’m not silly.”

      face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least
      curiosity?”
      “I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.”
      “But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?”
      “I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
      tale: it amuses me to watch them.”
      “What tale do you like best to hear?”
      “Oh, I have not much choice!&nbsp; They generally run on the same
      theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage.”
      “And do you like that monotonous theme?”
      “Positively, I don’t care about it: it is nothing to me.”
      “Nothing to you?&nbsp; When a lady, young and full of life and health,
      charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,
      sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”
      “I what?”
      “You know—and perhaps think well of.”
      “I don’t know the gentlemen here.&nbsp; I have scarcely interchanged a
      syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
      some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
      dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
      be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
      disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.”
      “You don’t know the gentlemen here?&nbsp; You have not exchanged a syllable
      with one of them?&nbsp; Will you say that of the master of the house!”
      “He is not at home.”
      “A profound remark!&nbsp; A most ingenious quibble!&nbsp; He went to Millcote this
      morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
      circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him, as
      it were, out of existence?”
      “No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
      you had introduced.”
      “I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late
      so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester’s eyes that they
      overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked
      that?”
      “Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.”
      “No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
      the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured
      with the most lively and the most continuous?”
      “The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.”&nbsp; I said
      this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
      manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.&nbsp; One unexpected
      sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
      of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
      weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every
      pulse.
      “Eagerness of a listener!” repeated she: “yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
      the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such
      delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing
      to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
      noticed this?”
      “Grateful!&nbsp; I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.”
      “Detecting!&nbsp; You have analysed, then.&nbsp; And what did you detect, if not
      gratitude?”
      I said nothing.
      “You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen
      him married, and beheld his bride happy?”
      “Humph!&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; Your witch’s skill is rather at fault sometimes.”
      “What the devil have you seen, then?”
      “Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.&nbsp; Is it known that
      Mr. Rochester is to be married?”
      “Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.”
      “Shortly?”
      “Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
      an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
      they will be a superlatively happy pair.&nbsp; He must love such a handsome,
      noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
      his person, at least his purse.&nbsp; I know she considers the Rochester
      estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
      something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
      grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.&nbsp; I would advise her
      blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
      clearer rent-roll,—he’s dished—”
      “But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester’s fortune: I came to
      hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.”
      “Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
      contradicted another.&nbsp; Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
      I know.&nbsp; I knew it before I came here this evening.&nbsp; She has laid it
      carefully on one side for you.&nbsp; I saw her do it.&nbsp; It depends on yourself
      to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
      the problem I study.&nbsp; Kneel again on the rug.”
      “Don’t keep me long; the fire scorches me.”
      I knelt.&nbsp; She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
      her chair.&nbsp; She began muttering,—
      “The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
      and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
      impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
      to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
      signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.&nbsp; It turns from me; it
      will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
      the truth of the discoveries I have already made,—to disown the charge
      both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me
      in my opinion.&nbsp; The eye is favourable.
      “As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
      impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
      on much the heart experiences.&nbsp; Mobile and flexible, it was never
      intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
      mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
      for its interlocutor.&nbsp; That feature too is propitious.
      “I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
      professes to say,—‘I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
      require me so to do.&nbsp; I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.&nbsp; I have an
      inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
      delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
      to give.’&nbsp; The forehead declares, ‘Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
      and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
      chasms.&nbsp; The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
      are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
      shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote
      in every decision.&nbsp; Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:
      but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which
      interprets the dictates of conscience.’
      “Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.&nbsp; I have
      formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to
      the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.&nbsp; I know how soon youth
      would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
      dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not
      want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste.&nbsp; I wish to
      foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood—no,
      nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in
      sweet—That will do.&nbsp; I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.&nbsp; I
      should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare
      not.&nbsp; So far I have governed myself thoroughly.&nbsp; I have acted as I
      inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my
      strength.&nbsp; Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out’.”
      Where was I?&nbsp; Did I wake or sleep?&nbsp; Had I been dreaming?&nbsp; Did I dream
      still?&nbsp; The old woman’s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
      all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my
      own tongue.&nbsp; I got up, but did not go.&nbsp; I looked; I stirred the fire,
      and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about
      her face, and again beckoned me to depart.&nbsp; The flame illuminated her
      hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at
      once noticed that hand.&nbsp; It was no more the withered limb of eld than my
      own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
      turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
      I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.&nbsp; Again
      I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me—on the
      contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head
      advanced.
      “Well, Jane, do you know me?” asked the familiar voice.
      “Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—”
      “But the string is in a knot—help me.”
      “Break it, sir.”
      “There, then—‘Off, ye lendings!’”&nbsp; And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
      disguise.
      “Now, sir, what a strange idea!”
      “But well carried out, eh?&nbsp; Don’t you think so?”
      “With the ladies you must have managed well.”
      “But not with you?”
      “You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.”
      “What character did I act?&nbsp; My own?”
      “No; some unaccountable one.&nbsp; In short, I believe you have been trying
      to draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
      nonsense.&nbsp; It is scarcely fair, sir.”
      “Do you forgive me, Jane?”
      “I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.&nbsp; If, on reflection, I
      find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
      but it was not right.”
      “Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible.”
      I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.&nbsp; It was a comfort; but,
      indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
      interview.&nbsp; Something of masquerade I suspected.&nbsp; I knew gipsies and
      fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
      expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
      conceal her features.&nbsp; But my mind had been running on Grace Poole—that
      living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.&nbsp; I had
      never thought of Mr. Rochester.
      “Well,” said he, “what are you musing about?&nbsp; What does that grave smile
      signify?”
      “Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.&nbsp; I have your permission to retire
      now, I suppose?”
      “No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
      yonder are doing.”
      “Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.”
      “Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me.”
      “I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o’clock.&nbsp; Oh,
      are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
      left this morning?”
      “A stranger!—no; who can it be?&nbsp; I expected no one; is he gone?”
      “No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty
      of installing himself here till you returned.”
      “The devil he did!&nbsp; Did he give his name?”
      “His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
      Town, in Jamaica, I think.”
      Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
      me to a chair.&nbsp; As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
      on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
      “Mason!—the West Indies!” he said, in the tone one might fancy a
      speaking automaton to enounce its single words; “Mason!—the West
      Indies!” he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
      growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
      seemed to know what he was doing.
      “Do you feel ill, sir?” I inquired.
      “Jane, I’ve got a blow; I’ve got a blow, Jane!”&nbsp; He staggered.
      “Oh, lean on me, sir.”
      “Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.”
      “Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.”
      He sat down, and made me sit beside him.&nbsp; Holding my hand in both his
      own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most
      troubled and dreary look.
      “My little friend!” said he, “I wish I were in a quiet island with only
      you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from
      me.”
      “Can I help you, sir?—I’d give my life to serve you.”
      “Jane, if aid is wanted, I’ll seek it at your hands; I promise you
      that.”
      “Thank you, sir.&nbsp; Tell me what to do,—I’ll try, at least, to do it.”
      “Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
      at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
      doing.”
      I went.&nbsp; I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
      Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,—the supper was
      arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
      about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their
      hands.&nbsp; Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were
      general and animated.&nbsp; Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel
      and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.&nbsp; I filled a
      wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she
      thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the
      library.
      Mr. Rochester’s extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
      firm and stern.&nbsp; He took the glass from my hand.
      “Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!” he said.&nbsp; He swallowed the
      contents and returned it to me.&nbsp; “What are they doing, Jane?”
      “Laughing and talking, sir.”
      “They don’t look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
      strange?”
      “Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.”
      “And Mason?”
      “He was laughing too.”
      “If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
      Jane?”
      “Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.”
      He half smiled.&nbsp; “But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at
      me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped
      off and left me one by one, what then?&nbsp; Would you go with them?”
      “I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
      you.”
      “To comfort me?”
      “Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.”
      “And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?”
      “I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I
      should care nothing about it.”
      “Then, you could dare censure for my sake?”
      “I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence;
      as you, I am sure, do.”
      “Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
      ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
      and then leave me.”
      “Yes, sir.”
      I did his behest.&nbsp; The company all stared at me as I passed straight
      among them.&nbsp; I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
      from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
      At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
      repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester’s voice, and
      heard him say, “This way, Mason; this is your room.”
      He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.&nbsp; I was soon
      asleep.
