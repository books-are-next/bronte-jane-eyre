CHAPTER VIII
Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and
all were gone into the refectory to tea.&nbsp; I now ventured to descend: it
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.&nbsp; The
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.&nbsp; Now I wept: Helen Burns was
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and
my tears watered the boards.&nbsp; I had meant to be so good, and to do so
much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win
affection.&nbsp; Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had
reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss
Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and
to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two
months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated
as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I
lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die.&nbsp; While sobbing out
this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again
Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the
long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.&nbsp;
Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my
agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.&nbsp; She sat down
on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her
head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.&nbsp; I
was the first who spoke—
“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
liar?”
“Everybody, Jane?&nbsp; Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.”
“But what have I to do with millions?&nbsp; The eighty, I know, despise me.”
“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.”
“How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?”
“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.&nbsp; Had
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
offer you sympathy if they dared.&nbsp; Teachers and pupils may look coldly
on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.&nbsp;
Besides, Jane”—she paused.
“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
gently to warm them, and went on—
“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
without friends.”
“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
others don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be
solitary and hated, Helen.&nbsp; Look here; to gain some real affection from
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or
to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—”
“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
self, or than creatures feeble as you.&nbsp; Besides this earth, and besides
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch
us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain
and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels
see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know
you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.&nbsp; Why,
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so
soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to glory?”
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.&nbsp; I felt the impression of
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
Resting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.&nbsp; We had not sat long thus,
when another person came in.&nbsp; Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure,
which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she; “I want you in my
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.”
We went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.&nbsp; Miss Temple
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face.&nbsp; “Have you cried
your grief away?”
“I am afraid I never shall do that.”
“Why?”
“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody
else, will now think me wicked.”
“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.&nbsp; Continue
to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.”
“Shall I, Miss Temple?”
“You will,” said she, passing her arm round me.&nbsp; “And now tell me who is
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”
“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife.&nbsp; My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
care.”
“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”
“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have
often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she
would always keep me.”
“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.&nbsp;
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
you can.&nbsp; Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
exaggerate nothing.”
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate—most
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
childhood.&nbsp; Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen’s
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.&nbsp; Thus restrained
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
Temple fully believed me.
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to
see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode
of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some
degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the
spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild
supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and
haunted chamber.
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
then said—
“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply
agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every
imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.”
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
contented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her
white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes),
she proceeded to address Helen Burns.
“How are you to-night, Helen?&nbsp; Have you coughed much to-day?”
“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”
“And the pain in your chest?”
“It is a little better.”
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.&nbsp; She
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—
“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.”&nbsp; She
rang her bell.
“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered it, “I have not yet had
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.”
And a tray was soon brought.&nbsp; How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!&nbsp;
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and butter?&nbsp;
There is not enough for three.”
Barbara went out: she returned soon—
“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.”
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Barbara, I
suppose.”&nbsp; And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before
each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she
got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she,
“but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a
controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen
Burns, I was struck with wonder.
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of
her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in
her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.&nbsp; They woke, they
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in
the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine colour nor
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
radiance.&nbsp; Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
source I cannot tell.&nbsp; Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
eloquence?&nbsp; Such was the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times
past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed
at: they spoke of books: how many they had read!&nbsp; What stores of
knowledge they possessed!&nbsp; Then they seemed so familiar with French
names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss
Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the
Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade
her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of
veneration expanding at every sounding line.&nbsp; She had scarcely finished
ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple
embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—
“God bless you, my children!”
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns’s, and when we
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that
to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles
pinned to her shoulder.
“My things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to me, in a
low voice: “I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.”
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
of pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound it like a phylactery round
Helen’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.&nbsp; She wore
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
punishment.&nbsp; The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,
I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of
which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,
hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle
of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
he said went to corroborate my account.&nbsp; Miss Temple, having assembled
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.&nbsp; The teachers
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
through the ranks of my companions.
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
allowed to commence French and drawing.&nbsp; I learned the first two tenses
of the verb Etre, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,
by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on
the same day.&nbsp; That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
young ivy sprays.&nbsp; I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
Well has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox and hatred therewith.”
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

      told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the

      the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”
      “Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife.&nbsp; My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
      care.”
      “Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”
      “No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have
      often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she
      would always keep me.”
      “Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a

      You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
      you can.&nbsp; Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and

      delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
      our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
      delicate fare she liberally supplied.
      Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
      one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
      Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
      Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
      mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
      into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
      pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a
      controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen
      Burns, I was struck with wonder.
      The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of
      her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in
      her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.&nbsp; They woke, they
      kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
      this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in
      the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
      singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine colour nor
      long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
      radiance.&nbsp; Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
      source I cannot tell.&nbsp; Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
      vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
      eloquence?&nbsp; Such was the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to
      me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
      brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
      They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times
      past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed
      at: they spoke of books: how many they had read!&nbsp; What stores of
      knowledge they possessed!&nbsp; Then they seemed so familiar with French
      names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss
      Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the
      Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade
      her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of
      veneration expanding at every sounding line.&nbsp; She had scarcely finished
      ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple
      embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—
      “God bless you, my children!”
      Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
      it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
      time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
      On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
      examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns’s, and when we
      entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that
      to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles
      pinned to her shoulder.
      “My things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to me, in a
      low voice: “I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.”
      Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
      of pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound it like a phylactery round
      Helen’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.&nbsp; She wore
      it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
      punishment.&nbsp; The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,
      I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of
      which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,
      hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle
      of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
      About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
      who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
      he said went to corroborate my account.&nbsp; Miss Temple, having assembled
      the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
      alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
      pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.&nbsp; The teachers
      then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
      through the ranks of my companions.
      Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
      resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
      my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
      tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
      weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
      allowed to commence French and drawing.&nbsp; I learned the first two tenses
      of the verb Etre, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,
      by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on
      the same day.&nbsp; That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
      imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
      and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
      feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
      dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
      picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
      of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
      cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
      young ivy sprays.&nbsp; I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
      ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
      which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
      to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
      Well has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
      stalled ox and hatred therewith.”
      I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
      Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
