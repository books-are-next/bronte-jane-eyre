CHAPTER XX
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
down my window-blind.&nbsp; The consequence was, that when the moon, which
was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.&nbsp; Awaking in the dead of
night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal clear.&nbsp; It
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
the curtain.
Good God!&nbsp; What a cry!
The night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.&nbsp;
The cry died, and was not renewed.&nbsp; Indeed, whatever being uttered that
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the
cloud shrouding his eyrie.&nbsp; The thing delivering such utterance must
rest ere it could repeat the effort.
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.&nbsp; And
overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
voice shouted—
“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.
“Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and
stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—
“Rochester!&nbsp; Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.&nbsp;
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
was silence.
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
from my apartment.&nbsp; The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.&nbsp; Gentlemen and
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is
hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there
robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.&nbsp;
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.&nbsp; They
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
confusion was inextricable.
“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent.&nbsp; “I cannot find him
in his bed.”
“Here! here!” was shouted in return.&nbsp; “Be composed, all of you: I’m
coming.”
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester
advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.&nbsp;
One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss
Ingram.
“What awful event has taken place?” said she.&nbsp; “Speak! let us know the
worst at once!”
“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
“All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried.&nbsp; “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much
Ado about Nothing.&nbsp; Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.&nbsp; Calming himself
by an effort, he added—
“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.&nbsp; She’s an excitable,
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.&nbsp; Now, then, I
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
she cannot be looked after.&nbsp; Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
ladies the example.&nbsp; Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in
evincing superiority to idle terrors.&nbsp; Amy and Louisa, return to your
nests like a pair of doves, as you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mesdames” (to the dowagers),
“you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill
gallery any longer.”
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.&nbsp; I did not
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
had left it.
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
carefully.&nbsp; The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not
a servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and
that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention
framed to pacify his guests.&nbsp; I dressed, then, to be ready for
emergencies.&nbsp; When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out
over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not
what.&nbsp; It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,
struggle, and call.
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and
in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.&nbsp; It
seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.&nbsp; Meantime the moon
declined: she was about to set.&nbsp; Not liking to sit in the cold and
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.&nbsp; I
left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I
stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
“Am I wanted?” I asked.
“Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master’s.
“Yes, sir.”
“And dressed?”
“Yes.”
“Come out, then, quietly.”
I obeyed.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
“I want you,” he said: “come this way: take your time, and make no
noise.”
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a
cat.&nbsp; He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the
dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood
at his side.
“Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper.
“Yes, sir.”
“Have you any salts—volatile salts?”
“Yes.”
“Go back and fetch both.”
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
and once more retraced my steps.&nbsp; He still waited; he held a key in his
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
he paused, and addressed me again.
“You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”
“I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
“Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting
fit.”
I put my fingers into his.&nbsp; “Warm and steady,” was his remark: he turned
the key and opened the door.
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry
was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had
then been concealed.&nbsp; This door was open; a light shone out of the room
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
quarrelling.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait
a minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment.&nbsp; A shout of
laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace
Poole’s own goblin ha! ha!&nbsp; She then was there.&nbsp; He made some sort of
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
came out and closed the door behind him.
“Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
the chamber.&nbsp; An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
back; his eyes were closed.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
blood.
“Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
of water from the washstand: “Hold that,” said he.&nbsp; I obeyed.&nbsp; He took
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.&nbsp; Mr. Mason
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester opened the shirt
of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged
away blood, trickling fast down.
“Is there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason.
“Pooh!&nbsp; No—a mere scratch.&nbsp; Don’t be so overcome, man: bear up!&nbsp; I’ll
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you’ll be able to be removed by
morning, I hope.&nbsp; Jane,” he continued.
“Sir?”
“I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an
hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it
returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that
stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose.&nbsp; You will not speak to
him on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if
you speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I’ll not answer
for the consequences.”
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.&nbsp;
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
use it as he had done.&nbsp; He watched me a second, then saying,
“Remember!—No conversation,” he left the room.&nbsp; I experienced a strange
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
step ceased to be heard.
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that
was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
I must keep to my post, however.&nbsp; I must watch this ghastly
countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.&nbsp; I must dip my hand again and
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling
gore.&nbsp; I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my
employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round
me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver
strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,
divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the
twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;
while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his
subordinate’s form.
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.&nbsp; But since
Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
Then my own thoughts worried me.&nbsp; What crime was this that lived
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?&nbsp; What creature was it, that,
masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of
a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at
him?&nbsp; What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely
season, when he should have been asleep in bed?&nbsp; I had heard Mr.
Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here!&nbsp; And why,
now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him?&nbsp; Why did
he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?&nbsp; Why
did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment?&nbsp; His guest had been
outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted
against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in
oblivion!&nbsp; Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that
the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness
of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of
this.&nbsp; It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive
disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active
energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when
he heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival?&nbsp; Why had the mere name of this
unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a
child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on
an oak?
Oh!&nbsp; I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
“Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.”&nbsp; I could not forget
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
“When will he come?&nbsp; When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night
lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
and neither day nor aid arrived.&nbsp; I had, again and again, held the water
to Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating
salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering,
or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his
strength.&nbsp; He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he
was dying; and I might not even speak to him.
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.&nbsp;
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
courtyard: hope revived.&nbsp; Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.&nbsp; It
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
shorter.
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
“Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last: “I give you but
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
patient downstairs and all.”
“But is he fit to move, sir?”
“No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
be kept up.&nbsp; Come, set to work.”
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,
let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see
how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten
the east.&nbsp; Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already
handling.
“Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked.
“She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply.
“Not a whit!—courage!&nbsp; This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the
worse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all.&nbsp; Carter, assure him
there’s no danger.”
“I can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the
bandages; “only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
bled so much—but how is this?&nbsp; The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
as cut.&nbsp; This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
here!”
“She bit me,” he murmured.&nbsp; “She worried me like a tigress, when
Rochester got the knife from her.”
“You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at
once,” said Mr. Rochester.
“But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason.&nbsp; “Oh,
it was frightful!” he added, shuddering.&nbsp; “And I did not expect it: she
looked so quiet at first.”
“I warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said—be on your guard when
you go near her.&nbsp; Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
alone.”
“I thought I could have done some good.”
“You thought! you thought!&nbsp; Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
taking my advice; so I’ll say no more.&nbsp; Carter—hurry!—hurry!&nbsp; The sun
will soon rise, and I must have him off.”
“Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.&nbsp; I must look to this
other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.”
“She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,” said Mason.
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
said—
“Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat
it.”
“I wish I could forget it,” was the answer.
“You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not
think of her at all.”
“Impossible to forget this night!”
“It is not impossible: have some energy, man.&nbsp; You thought you were as
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking
now.&nbsp; There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent
in a trice.&nbsp; Jane” (he turned to me for the first time since his
re-entrance), “take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight
forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and
take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be
nimble.”
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles
named, and returned with them.
“Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while I order his
toilet; but don’t leave the room: you may be wanted again.”
I retired as directed.
“Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired Mr.
Rochester presently.
“No, sir; all was very still.”
“We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for
your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.&nbsp; I have striven
long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.&nbsp; Here,
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.&nbsp; Where did you leave your
furred cloak?&nbsp; You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this
damned cold climate.&nbsp; In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s
room,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there.”
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
edged with fur.
“Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you must
away to my room again.&nbsp; What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.&nbsp; You must open
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
little glass you will find there,—quick!”
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
“That’s well!&nbsp; Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
dose myself, on my own responsibility.&nbsp; I got this cordial at Rome, of
an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.&nbsp; It is not
a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as
now, for instance.&nbsp; Jane, a little water.”
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle
on the washstand.
“That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
to Mason.
“Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or
so.”
“But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?”
“Drink! drink! drink!”
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.&nbsp; He was
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and
sullied.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed
the liquid; he then took his arm—
“Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.”
The patient rose.
“Carter, take him under the other shoulder.&nbsp; Be of good cheer, Richard;
step out—that’s it!”
“I do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason.
“I am sure you do.&nbsp; Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.&nbsp; The side-passage
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
stationed outside.&nbsp; I approached him, and said the gentlemen were
coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.&nbsp; The
stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet
drawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just
twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped
like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the
carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all
else was still.
The gentlemen now appeared.&nbsp; Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
chaise; Carter followed.
“Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep him at
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
see how he gets on.&nbsp; Richard, how is it with you?”
“The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.”
“Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,
Dick.”
“Fairfax—”
“Well what is it?”
“Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
her—” he stopped and burst into tears.
“I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: he
shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
“Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester, as
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
the wall bordering the orchard.&nbsp; I, supposing he had done with me,
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call
“Jane!”&nbsp; He had opened feel portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that
house is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”
“It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”
“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.&nbsp; Now here”
(he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet,
and pure.”
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.&nbsp;
They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,
followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just
entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy
orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.
“Jane, will you have a flower?”
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
me.
“Thank you, sir.”
“Do you like this sunrise, Jane?&nbsp; That sky with its high and light
clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid and
balmly atmosphere?”
“I do, very much.”
“You have passed a strange night, Jane.”
“Yes, sir.”
“And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone
with Mason?”
“I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”
“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a
wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”
“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”
“Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your
thoughts.”
“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”
“Never fear—I will take care of myself.”
“Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”
“I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.&nbsp;
To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
spue fire any day.”
“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.&nbsp; Your influence, sir, is
evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully
injure you.”
“Oh, no!&nbsp; Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”
“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
how to avert the danger.”
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
from him.
“If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?&nbsp; Annihilated
in a moment.&nbsp; Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
him ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done.&nbsp; But I cannot give him
orders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for
it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is
possible.&nbsp; Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.&nbsp; You are
my little friend, are you not?”
“I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”
“Precisely: I see you do.&nbsp; I see genuine contentment in your gait and
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me—working
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, ‘all that is
right:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
animated complexion.&nbsp; My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
and would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed star.&nbsp; Well, you too
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I
am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should
transfix me at once.”
“If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
you are very safe.”
“God grant it may be so!&nbsp; Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a
rustic seat.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but
I stood before him.
“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two.&nbsp; You don’t hesitate
to take a place at my side, do you?&nbsp; Is that wrong, Jane?”
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been
unwise.
“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease,
and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in
staying.”
“No, sir; I am content.”
“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
taint all your existence.&nbsp; Mind, I don’t say a crime; I am not
speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make
the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error.&nbsp; The results
of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you
take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful
nor culpable.&nbsp; Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the
very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you
feel will not leave it till the time of setting.&nbsp; Bitter and base
associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here
and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in
heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights
feeling.&nbsp; Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of
voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no
matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities
which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;
and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.&nbsp; Such
society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher
wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend
what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.&nbsp;
To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of
custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience
sanctifies nor your judgment approves?”
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?&nbsp; Oh, for some good
spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!&nbsp; Vain
aspiration!&nbsp; The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle
Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the
tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
“Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
peace of mind and regeneration of life?”
“Sir,” I answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation should
never depend on a fellow-creature.&nbsp; Men and women die; philosophers
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
amend and solace to heal.”
“But the instrument—the instrument!&nbsp; God, who does the work, ordains the
instrument.&nbsp; I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,
dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for
my cure in—”
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.&nbsp; I
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes—so
long was the silence protracted.&nbsp; At last I looked up at the tardy
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
“Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face changed
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
sarcastic—“you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don’t
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?”
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when
he came back he was humming a tune.
“Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before me, “you are quite pale with your
vigils: don’t you curse me for disturbing your rest?”
“Curse you?&nbsp; No, sir.”
“Shake hands in confirmation of the word.&nbsp; What cold fingers!&nbsp; They were
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
chamber.&nbsp; Jane, when will you watch with me again?”
“Whenever I can be useful, sir.”
“For instance, the night before I am married!&nbsp; I am sure I shall not be
able to sleep.&nbsp; Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?&nbsp;
To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know
her.”
“Yes, sir.”
“She’s a rare one, is she not, Jane?”
“Yes, sir.”
“A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.&nbsp; Bless me! there’s Dent
and Lynn in the stables!&nbsp; Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.”
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
cheerfully—
“Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before
sunrise: I rose at four to see him off.”

      CHAPTER XX
      I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
      down my window-blind.&nbsp; The consequence was, that when the moon, which
      was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
      space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
      unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.&nbsp; Awaking in the dead of
      night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal clear.&nbsp; It
      was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
      the curtain.
      Good God!&nbsp; What a cry!
      The night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
      a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
      My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.&nbsp;
      The cry died, and was not renewed.&nbsp; Indeed, whatever being uttered that
      fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
      the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the
      cloud shrouding his eyrie.&nbsp; The thing delivering such utterance must
      rest ere it could repeat the effort.
      It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.&nbsp; And
      overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a
      struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
      voice shouted—
      “Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.
      “Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and
      stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—
      “Rochester!&nbsp; Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”
      A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.&nbsp;
      Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
      was silence.
      I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
      from my apartment.&nbsp; The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
      terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
      looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.&nbsp; Gentlemen and
      ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is
      hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there
      robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.&nbsp;
      But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.&nbsp; They
      ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
      confusion was inextricable.
      “Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent.&nbsp; “I cannot find him
      in his bed.”
      “Here! here!” was shouted in return.&nbsp; “Be composed, all of you: I’m
      coming.”
      And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester
      advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.&nbsp;
      One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss
      Ingram.
      “What awful event has taken place?” said she.&nbsp; “Speak! let us know the
      worst at once!”
      “But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses
      Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
      wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
      “All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried.&nbsp; “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much
      Ado about Nothing.&nbsp; Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”
      And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.&nbsp; Calming himself
      by an effort, he added—
      “A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.&nbsp; She’s an excitable,
      nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
      of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.&nbsp; Now, then, I
      must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
      she cannot be looked after.&nbsp; Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
      ladies the example.&nbsp; Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in
      evincing superiority to idle terrors.&nbsp; Amy and Louisa, return to your
      nests like a pair of doves, as you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mesdames” (to the dowagers),
      “you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill
      gallery any longer.”
      And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
      them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.&nbsp; I did not
      wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
      had left it.
      Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
      carefully.&nbsp; The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
      had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
      proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not
      a servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and
      that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention
      framed to pacify his guests.&nbsp; I dressed, then, to be ready for
      emergencies.&nbsp; When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out
      over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not
      what.&nbsp; It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,
      struggle, and call.
      No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and
      in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.&nbsp; It
      seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.&nbsp; Meantime the moon
      declined: she was about to set.&nbsp; Not liking to sit in the cold and
      darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.&nbsp; I
      left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I
      stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
      “Am I wanted?” I asked.
      “Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master’s.
      “Yes, sir.”
      “And dressed?”
      “Yes.”
      “Come out, then, quietly.”
      I obeyed.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
      “I want you,” he said: “come this way: take your time, and make no
      noise.”
      My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a
      cat.&nbsp; He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the
      dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood
      at his side.
      “Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper.
      “Yes, sir.”
      “Have you any salts—volatile salts?”
      “Yes.”
      “Go back and fetch both.”
      I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
      and once more retraced my steps.&nbsp; He still waited; he held a key in his
      hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
      he paused, and addressed me again.
      “You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”
      “I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”
      I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
      “Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting
      fit.”
      I put my fingers into his.&nbsp; “Warm and steady,” was his remark: he turned
      the key and opened the door.
      I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
      showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry
      was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had
      then been concealed.&nbsp; This door was open; a light shone out of the room
      within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
      quarrelling.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait
      a minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment.&nbsp; A shout of
      laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace
      Poole’s own goblin ha! ha!&nbsp; She then was there.&nbsp; He made some sort of
      arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
      came out and closed the door behind him.
      “Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
      bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
      the chamber.&nbsp; An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
      dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
      back; his eyes were closed.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
      recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:
      I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
      blood.
      “Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
      of water from the washstand: “Hold that,” said he.&nbsp; I obeyed.&nbsp; He took
      the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
      for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.&nbsp; Mr. Mason
      shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester opened the shirt
      of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged
      away blood, trickling fast down.
      “Is there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason.
      “Pooh!&nbsp; No—a mere scratch.&nbsp; Don’t be so overcome, man: bear up!&nbsp; I’ll
      fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you’ll be able to be removed by
      morning, I hope.&nbsp; Jane,” he continued.
      “Sir?”
      “I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an
      hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it
      returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that
      stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose.&nbsp; You will not speak to
      him on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if
      you speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I’ll not answer
      for the consequences.”
      Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
      either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.&nbsp;
      Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
      use it as he had done.&nbsp; He watched me a second, then saying,
      “Remember!—No conversation,” he left the room.&nbsp; I experienced a strange
      feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
      step ceased to be heard.
      Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
      cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
      hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that
      was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
      Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
      I must keep to my post, however.&nbsp; I must watch this ghastly
      countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now
      shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
      ever glazed with the dulness of horror.&nbsp; I must dip my hand again and
      again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling
      gore.&nbsp; I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my
      employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round
      me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver
      strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,
      divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the
      twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;
      while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
      According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
      glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
      brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
      Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
      threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his
      subordinate’s form.
      Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
      movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.&nbsp; But since
      Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
      three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal
      of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
      Then my own thoughts worried me.&nbsp; What crime was this that lived
      incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
      subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
      in blood, at the deadest hours of night?&nbsp; What creature was it, that,
      masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of
      a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
      And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he
      become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at
      him?&nbsp; What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely
      season, when he should have been asleep in bed?&nbsp; I had heard Mr.
      Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here!&nbsp; And why,
      now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him?&nbsp; Why did
      he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?&nbsp; Why
      did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment?&nbsp; His guest had been
      outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted
      against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in
      oblivion!&nbsp; Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that
      the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness
      of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of
      this.&nbsp; It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive
      disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active
      energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when
      he heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival?&nbsp; Why had the mere name of this
      unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a
      child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on
      an oak?
      Oh!&nbsp; I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
      “Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.”&nbsp; I could not forget
      how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
      light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
      vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
      “When will he come?&nbsp; When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night
      lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
      and neither day nor aid arrived.&nbsp; I had, again and again, held the water
      to Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating
      salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering,
      or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his
      strength.&nbsp; He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he
      was dying; and I might not even speak to him.
      The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
      of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.&nbsp;
      Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
      courtyard: hope revived.&nbsp; Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
      the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.&nbsp; It
      could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
      shorter.
      Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
      “Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last: “I give you but
      half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
      patient downstairs and all.”
      “But is he fit to move, sir?”
      “No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
      be kept up.&nbsp; Come, set to work.”
      Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,
      let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see
      how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten
      the east.&nbsp; Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already
      handling.
      “Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked.
      “She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply.
      “Not a whit!—courage!&nbsp; This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the
      worse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all.&nbsp; Carter, assure him
      there’s no danger.”
      “I can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the
      bandages; “only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
      bled so much—but how is this?&nbsp; The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
      as cut.&nbsp; This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
      here!”
      “She bit me,” he murmured.&nbsp; “She worried me like a tigress, when
      Rochester got the knife from her.”
      “You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at
      once,” said Mr. Rochester.
      “But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason.&nbsp; “Oh,
      it was frightful!” he added, shuddering.&nbsp; “And I did not expect it: she
      looked so quiet at first.”
      “I warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said—be on your guard when
      you go near her.&nbsp; Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
      me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
      alone.”
      “I thought I could have done some good.”
      “You thought! you thought!&nbsp; Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
      however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
      taking my advice; so I’ll say no more.&nbsp; Carter—hurry!—hurry!&nbsp; The sun
      will soon rise, and I must have him off.”
      “Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.&nbsp; I must look to this
      other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.”
      “She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,” said Mason.
      I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
      horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
      said—
      “Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat
      it.”
      “I wish I could forget it,” was the answer.
      “You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
      Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not
      think of her at all.”
      “Impossible to forget this night!”
      “It is not impossible: have some energy, man.&nbsp; You thought you were as
      dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking
      now.&nbsp; There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent
      in a trice.&nbsp; Jane” (he turned to me for the first time since his
      re-entrance), “take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight
      forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and
      take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be
      nimble.”
      I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles
      named, and returned with them.
      “Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while I order his
      toilet; but don’t leave the room: you may be wanted again.”
      I retired as directed.
      “Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired Mr.
      Rochester presently.
      “No, sir; all was very still.”
      “We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for
      your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.&nbsp; I have striven
      long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.&nbsp; Here,
      Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.&nbsp; Where did you leave your
      furred cloak?&nbsp; You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this
      damned cold climate.&nbsp; In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s
      room,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there.”
      Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
      edged with fur.
      “Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you must
      away to my room again.&nbsp; What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a
      clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.&nbsp; You must open
      the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
      little glass you will find there,—quick!”
      I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
      “That’s well!&nbsp; Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
      dose myself, on my own responsibility.&nbsp; I got this cordial at Rome, of
      an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.&nbsp; It is not
      a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as
      now, for instance.&nbsp; Jane, a little water.”
      He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle
      on the washstand.
      “That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”
      I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
      to Mason.
      “Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or
      so.”
      “But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?”
      “Drink! drink! drink!”
      Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.&nbsp; He was
      dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and
      sullied.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed
      the liquid; he then took his arm—
      “Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.”
      The patient rose.
      “Carter, take him under the other shoulder.&nbsp; Be of good cheer, Richard;
      step out—that’s it!”
      “I do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason.
      “I am sure you do.&nbsp; Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
      unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
      will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
      rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
      if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”
      It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
      rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.&nbsp; The side-passage
      door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
      yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
      post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
      stationed outside.&nbsp; I approached him, and said the gentlemen were
      coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.&nbsp; The
      stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet
      drawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just
      twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped
      like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the
      carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all
      else was still.
      The gentlemen now appeared.&nbsp; Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
      surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
      chaise; Carter followed.
      “Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep him at
      your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
      see how he gets on.&nbsp; Richard, how is it with you?”
      “The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.”
      “Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,
      Dick.”
      “Fairfax—”
      “Well what is it?”
      “Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
      her—” he stopped and burst into tears.
      “I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: he
      shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
      “Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester, as
      he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
      This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
      the wall bordering the orchard.&nbsp; I, supposing he had done with me,
      prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call
      “Jane!”&nbsp; He had opened feel portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
      “Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that
      house is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”
      “It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”
      “The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you
      see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
      slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
      and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.&nbsp; Now here”
      (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet,
      and pure.”
      He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
      cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
      old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
      mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.&nbsp;
      They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,
      followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just
      entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy
      orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.
      “Jane, will you have a flower?”
      He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
      me.
      “Thank you, sir.”
      “Do you like this sunrise, Jane?&nbsp; That sky with its high and light
      clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid and
      balmly atmosphere?”
      “I do, very much.”
      “You have passed a strange night, Jane.”
      “Yes, sir.”
      “And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone
      with Mason?”
      “I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”
      “But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have
      been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a
      wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”
      “Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”
      “Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your
      thoughts.”
      “Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”
      “Never fear—I will take care of myself.”
      “Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”
      “I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.&nbsp;
      To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
      spue fire any day.”
      “But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.&nbsp; Your influence, sir, is
      evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully
      injure you.”
      “Oh, no!&nbsp; Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,
      unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
      if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”
      “Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
      how to avert the danger.”
      He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
      from him.
      “If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?&nbsp; Annihilated
      in a moment.&nbsp; Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
      him ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done.&nbsp; But I cannot give him
      orders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for
      it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is
      possible.&nbsp; Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.&nbsp; You are
      my little friend, are you not?”
      “I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”
      “Precisely: I see you do.&nbsp; I see genuine contentment in your gait and
      mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me—working
      for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, ‘all that is
      right:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
      light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
      animated complexion.&nbsp; My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
      and would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
      is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed star.&nbsp; Well, you too
      have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I
      am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should
      transfix me at once.”
      “If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
      you are very safe.”
      “God grant it may be so!&nbsp; Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”
      The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a
      rustic seat.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but
      I stood before him.
      “Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two.&nbsp; You don’t hesitate
      to take a place at my side, do you?&nbsp; Is that wrong, Jane?”
      I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been
      unwise.
      “Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the
      flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
      young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
      first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
      suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease,
      and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in
      staying.”
      “No, sir; I am content.”
      “Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a
      girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
      upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
      there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
      motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
      taint all your existence.&nbsp; Mind, I don’t say a crime; I am not
      speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make
      the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error.&nbsp; The results
      of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you
      take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful
      nor culpable.&nbsp; Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the
      very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you
      feel will not leave it till the time of setting.&nbsp; Bitter and base
      associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here
      and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in
      heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights
      feeling.&nbsp; Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of
      voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no
      matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities
      which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;
      and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.&nbsp; Such
      society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher
      wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend
      what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.&nbsp;
      To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of
      custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience
      sanctifies nor your judgment approves?”
      He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?&nbsp; Oh, for some good
      spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!&nbsp; Vain
      aspiration!&nbsp; The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle
      Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the
      tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
      Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
      “Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
      justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for
      ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
      peace of mind and regeneration of life?”
      “Sir,” I answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation should
      never depend on a fellow-creature.&nbsp; Men and women die; philosophers
      falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
      suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
      amend and solace to heal.”
      “But the instrument—the instrument!&nbsp; God, who does the work, ordains the
      instrument.&nbsp; I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,
      dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for
      my cure in—”
      He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.&nbsp; I
      almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
      suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes—so
      long was the silence protracted.&nbsp; At last I looked up at the tardy
      speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
      “Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face changed
      too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
      sarcastic—“you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don’t
      you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?”
      He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when
      he came back he was humming a tune.
      “Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before me, “you are quite pale with your
      vigils: don’t you curse me for disturbing your rest?”
      “Curse you?&nbsp; No, sir.”
      “Shake hands in confirmation of the word.&nbsp; What cold fingers!&nbsp; They were
      warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
      chamber.&nbsp; Jane, when will you watch with me again?”
      “Whenever I can be useful, sir.”
      “For instance, the night before I am married!&nbsp; I am sure I shall not be
      able to sleep.&nbsp; Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?&nbsp;
      To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know
      her.”
      “Yes, sir.”
      “She’s a rare one, is she not, Jane?”
      “Yes, sir.”
      “A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
      such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.&nbsp; Bless me! there’s Dent
      and Lynn in the stables!&nbsp; Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.”
      As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
      cheerfully—
      “Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before
      sunrise: I rose at four to see him off.”
