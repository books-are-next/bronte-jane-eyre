          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="5" data-nb-words="151" data-nb-chars="930"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="151" data-nb-chars="930">I&nbsp;wondered what they were going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the first evening a&nbsp;change of&nbsp;entertainment was proposed: they spoke of&nbsp;“playing charades,” but in&nbsp;my&nbsp;ignorance I&nbsp;did not understand the term.&nbsp; The servants were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;semicircle opposite the arch.&nbsp; While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up&nbsp;and down stairs ringing for their maids.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to&nbsp;give information respecting the resources of&nbsp;the house in&nbsp;shawls, dresses, draperies of&nbsp;any kind; and certain wardrobes of&nbsp;the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &amp;c., were brought down in&nbsp;armfuls by&nbsp;the abigails; then a&nbsp;selection was made, and such things as&nbsp;were chosen were carried to&nbsp;the boudoir within the drawing-room.</span></p>

          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="7" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="156"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="31" data-nb-chars="156">“Will you play?” he&nbsp;asked.&nbsp; I&nbsp;shook my&nbsp;head.&nbsp; He&nbsp;did not insist, which I&nbsp;rather feared he&nbsp;would have done; he&nbsp;allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;return quietly to&nbsp;my&nbsp;usual seat.</span></p>
          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="8" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="287"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="287">He&nbsp;and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by&nbsp;Colonel Dent, sat down on&nbsp;the crescent of&nbsp;chairs.&nbsp; One of&nbsp;the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to&nbsp;propose that I&nbsp;should be&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.</span></p>

          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="13" data-nb-words="135" data-nb-chars="805"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="135" data-nb-chars="805">Seated on&nbsp;the carpet, by&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in&nbsp;shawls, with a&nbsp;turban on&nbsp;his head.&nbsp; His dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he&nbsp;looked the very model of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Eastern emir, an&nbsp;agent or&nbsp;a&nbsp;victim of&nbsp;the bowstring.&nbsp; Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.&nbsp; She, too, was attired in&nbsp;oriental fashion: a&nbsp;crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an&nbsp;embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of&nbsp;them upraised in&nbsp;the act of&nbsp;supporting a&nbsp;pitcher, poised gracefully on&nbsp;her head.&nbsp; Both her cast of&nbsp;form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea of&nbsp;some Israelitish princess of&nbsp;the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character she intended to&nbsp;represent.</span></p>
          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="14" data-nb-words="114" data-nb-chars="649"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="114" data-nb-chars="649">She approached the basin, and bent over it&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;to&nbsp;fill her pitcher; she again lifted it&nbsp;to&nbsp;her head.&nbsp; The personage on&nbsp;the well-brink now seemed to&nbsp;accost her; to&nbsp;make some request:—“She hasted, let down her pitcher on&nbsp;her hand, and gave him to&nbsp;drink.”&nbsp; From the bosom of&nbsp;his robe he&nbsp;then produced a&nbsp;casket, opened it&nbsp;and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he&nbsp;laid the treasure at&nbsp;her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by&nbsp;her looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on&nbsp;her arms and the rings in&nbsp;her ears.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.</span></p>
          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="15" data-nb-words="36" data-nb-chars="241"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="36" data-nb-chars="241">The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not agree about the word or&nbsp;syllable the scene illustrated.&nbsp; Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of&nbsp;the whole;” whereupon the curtain again descended.</span></p>
          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="16" data-nb-words="64" data-nb-chars="359"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="idea15" data-nb-words="64" data-nb-chars="359">On&nbsp;its third rising only a&nbsp;portion of&nbsp;the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest being concealed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;screen, hung with some sort of&nbsp;dark and coarse drapery.&nbsp; The marble basin was removed; in&nbsp;its place, stood a&nbsp;deal table and a&nbsp;kitchen chair: these objects were visible by&nbsp;a&nbsp;very dim light proceeding from a&nbsp;horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.</span></p>
          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="17" data-nb-words="79" data-nb-chars="446"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="79" data-nb-chars="446">Amidst this sordid scene, sat a&nbsp;man with his clenched hands resting on&nbsp;his knees, and his eyes bent on&nbsp;the ground.&nbsp; I&nbsp;knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one arm, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been almost torn from his back in&nbsp;a&nbsp;scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him.&nbsp; As&nbsp;he&nbsp;moved, a&nbsp;chain clanked; to&nbsp;his wrists were attached fetters.</span></p>
          <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="18" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="64"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="64">“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.</span></p>
