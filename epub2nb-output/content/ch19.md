title: "\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nA week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still\nhe did not come.\_ Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he\nwere to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the\nContinent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come;\nhe had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and\nunexpected.\_ When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill\nand failing at the heart.\_ I was actually permitting myself to\nexperience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits,\nand recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order;\nand it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I cleared\nup the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter in which\nI had any cause to take a vital interest.\_ Not that I humbled myself by\na slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said—\n\n“You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to\nreceive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be\ngrateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,\nyou have a right to expect at his hands.\_ Be sure that is the only tie\nhe seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him the\nobject of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.\_ He\nis not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to\nlavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a\ngift is not wanted and would be despised.”\n\nI went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague\nsuggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit\nThornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and\npondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not\nthink to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.\n\nMr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post\nbrought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.\n\n“It is from the master,” said she, as she looked at the direction.\_ “Now\nI suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.”\n\nAnd while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking\nmy coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that\ncircumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.\_ Why my hand\nshook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my\nsaucer, I did not choose to consider.\n\n“Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being\nbusy enough now: for a little while at least,” said Mrs. Fairfax, still\nholding the note before her spectacles.\n\nEre I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of\nAdèle’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to\nanother bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—\n\n“Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?”\n\n“Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and\nnot alone either.\_ I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas\nare coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be\nprepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am\nto get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from\nwherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the\ngentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.”\_ And Mrs.\nFairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence\noperations.\n\nThe three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.\_ I had thought\nall the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it\nappears I was mistaken.\_ Three women were got to help; and such\nscrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,\nsuch taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors\nand lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets\nand feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.\_\nAdèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company\nand the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.\_\nShe would have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called\nfrocks; to furbish up any that were “passées,” and to air and\narrange the new.\_ For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the\nfront chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses\nand piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in\nthe chimneys.\_ From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had\npressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping\n(or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and\ncheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.\n\nThe party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for\ndinner at six.\_ During the intervening period I had no time to nurse\nchimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle\nexcepted.\_ Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my\ncheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of\ndoubts and portents, and dark conjectures.\_ This was when I chanced to\nsee the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept\nlocked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in\nprim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along\nthe gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her\nlook into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps,\nto the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a\nmarble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass\non.\_ She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner,\nsmoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of\nporter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper\nhaunt.\_ Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her\nfellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some\nlow-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and\nsewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a\nprisoner in his dungeon.\n\nThe strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,\nnoticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her\nposition or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.\_ I\nonce, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the\ncharwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.\_ Leah had been saying\nsomething I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—\n\n“She gets good wages, I guess?”\n\n“Yes,” said Leah; “I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain\nof,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one fifth of\nthe sum Mrs. Poole receives.\_ And she is laying by: she goes every\nquarter to the bank at Millcote.\_ I should not wonder but she has saved\nenough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose\nshe’s got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong\nand able for anything.\_ It is too soon for her to give up business.”\n\n“She is a good hand, I daresay,” said the charwoman.\n\n“Ah!—she understands what she has to do,—nobody better,” rejoined Leah\nsignificantly; “and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for all\nthe money she gets.”\n\n“That it is not!” was the reply.\_ “I wonder whether the master—”\n\nThe charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and\nshe instantly gave her companion a nudge.\n\n“Doesn’t she know?” I heard the woman whisper.\n\nLeah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.\_ All I\nhad gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at\nThornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely\nexcluded.\n\nThursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets\nwere laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes\nspread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in\nvases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands\ncould make them.\_ The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved\nclock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were\npolished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard\nflashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases\nof exotics bloomed on all sides.\n\nAfternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her\ngloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the\ncompany,—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.\_ Adèle, too, would be\ndressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to\nthe party that day at least.\_ However, to please her, I allowed Sophie\nto apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.\_ For myself, I\nhad no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my\nsanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,—“a\nvery pleasant refuge in time of trouble.”\n\nIt had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards\nthe end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth\nas heralds of summer.\_ It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was\neven warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.\n\n“It gets late,” said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.\_ “I am\nglad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned;\nfor it is past six now.\_ I have sent John down to the gates to see if\nthere is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the\ndirection of Millcote.”\_ She went to the window.\_ “Here he is!” said\nshe.\_ “Well, John” (leaning out), “any news?”\n\n“They’re coming, ma’am,” was the answer.\_ “They’ll be here in ten\nminutes.”\n\nAdèle flew to the window.\_ I followed, taking care to stand on one side,\nso that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\n\nThe ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were\nheard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two\nopen carriages.\_ Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;\ntwo of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third\nwas Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before\nhim; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the\nparty.\_ Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil\nstreamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and\ngleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.\n\n“Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post\nbelow.\n\nThe cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the\nangle of the house, and I lost sight of it.\_ Adèle now petitioned to go\ndown; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she\nmust not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,\neither now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr.\nRochester would be very angry, &c.\_ “Some natural tears she shed” on\nbeing told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at\nlast to wipe them.\n\nA joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and\nladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable\nabove all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of\nThornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.\_\nThen light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through\nthe gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,\nand, for a time, a hush.\n\n“Elles changent de toilettes,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively,\nhad followed every movement; and she sighed.\n\n“Chez maman,” said she, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais\npartout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes\nde chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme\ncela on apprend.”\n\n“Don’t you feel hungry, Adèle?”\n\n“Mais oui, mademoiselle: voilà cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons pas\nmangé.”\n\n“Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and\nget you something to eat.”\n\nAnd issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which\nconducted directly to the kitchen.\_ All in that region was fire and\ncommotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and\nthe cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening\nspontaneous combustion.\_ In the servants’ hall two coachmen and three\ngentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I\nsuppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had\nbeen hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.\_ Threading\nthis chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a\ncold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife\nand fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.\_ I had regained the\ngallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an\naccelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their\nchambers.\_ I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of\ntheir doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of\nvictualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was\ndark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.\n\nPresently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another:\neach came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through\nthe dusk.\_ For a moment they stood grouped together at the other\nextremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity:\nthey then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist\nrolls down a hill.\_ Their collective appearance had left on me an\nimpression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.\n\nI found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.\_\n“What beautiful ladies!” cried she in English.\_ “Oh, I wish I might go\nto them!\_ Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after\ndinner?”\n\n“No, indeed, I don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.\_\nNever mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow:\nhere is your dinner.”\n\nShe was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her\nattention for a time.\_ It was well I secured this forage, or both she,\nI, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run\na chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much\nengaged to think of us.\_ The dessert was not carried out till after nine\nand at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and\ncoffee-cups.\_ I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for she\ndeclared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening\nand shutting below, and people bustling about.\_ Besides, she added, a\nmessage might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed;\n“et alors quel dommage!”\n\nI told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a\nchange I took her out into the gallery.\_ The hall lamp was now lit, and\nit amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing\nbackwards and forwards.\_ When the evening was far advanced, a sound of\nmusic issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;\nAdèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.\_ Presently\na voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who\nsang, and very sweet her notes were.\_ The solo over, a duet followed,\nand then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the\nintervals.\_ I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was\nwholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to\ndiscriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and\nwhen it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in\nframing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.\n\nThe clock struck eleven.\_ I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against my\nshoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and\ncarried her off to bed.\_ It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies\nsought their chambers.\n\nThe next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party\nto an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.\_ They set out early\nin the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed\nboth the departure and the return.\_ Miss Ingram, as before, was the only\nlady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the\ntwo rode a little apart from the rest.\_ I pointed out this circumstance\nto Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me—\n\n“You said it was not likely they should think of being married,” said I,\n“but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other\nladies.”\n\n“Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.”\n\n“And she him,” I added; “look how she leans her head towards him as if\nshe were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have\nnever had a glimpse of it yet.”\n\n“You will see her this evening,” answered Mrs. Fairfax.\_ “I happened to\nremark to Mr. Rochester how much Adèle wished to be introduced to the\nladies, and he said: ‘Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after\ndinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.’”\n\n“Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,” I\nanswered.\n\n“Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not\nthink you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and\nhe replied, in his quick way—‘Nonsense!\_ If she objects, tell her it is\nmy particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her\nin case of contumacy.’”\n\n“I will not give him that trouble,” I answered.\_ “I will go, if no\nbetter may be; but I don’t like it.\_ Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?”\n\n“No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.\_ I’ll tell you how to\nmanage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance,\nwhich is the most disagreeable part of the business.\_ You must go into\nthe drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the\ndinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not\nstay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr.\nRochester see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you.”\n\n“Will these people remain long, do you think?”\n\n“Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.\_ After the Easter\nrecess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote,\nwill have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester\nwill accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so\nprotracted a stay at Thornfield.”\n\nIt was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I\nwas to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.\_ Adèle had been in a\nstate of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the\nladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the\noperation of dressing her that she sobered down.\_ Then the importance of\nthe process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls\narranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put\non, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as\ngrave as any judge.\_ No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire:\nwhen she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking\ncare previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease\nit, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.\_ This I\nquickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss\nTemple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was\nsoon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.\_ We\ndescended.\n\nFortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that\nthrough the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.\_ We found the\napartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth,\nand wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers\nwith which the tables were adorned.\_ The crimson curtain hung before the\narch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in\nthe adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their\nconversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.\n\nAdèle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most\nsolemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I\npointed out to her.\_ I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from\na table near, endeavoured to read.\_ Adèle brought her stool to my feet;\nere long she touched my knee.\n\n“What is it, Adèle?”\n\n“Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,\nmademoiselle?\_ Seulement pour completer ma toilette.”\n\n“You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adèle: but you may have a\nflower.”\_ And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.\_\nShe sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness\nwere now full.\_ I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not\nsuppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little\nParisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.\n\nA soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back\nfrom the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre\npouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent\ndessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the\nopening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.\n\nThere were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the\nimpression of a much larger number.\_ Some of them were very tall; many\nwere dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that\nseemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.\_ I rose\nand curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others\nonly stared at me.\n\nThey dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and\nbuoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.\_ Some of\nthem threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and\nottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:\nthe rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but\nclear tone which seemed habitual to them.\_ I knew their names\nafterwards, and may as well mention them now.\n\nFirst, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.\_ She had\nevidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.\_ Of her\ndaughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in\nface and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue\nsash became her well.\_ The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant\nin figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term\nminois chiffoné: both sisters were fair as lilies.\n\nLady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,\nvery haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:\nher dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and\nwithin the circlet of a band of gems.\n\nMrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.\_ She\nhad a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.\_ Her black\nsatin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments,\npleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.\n\nBut the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest\nfigures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,\nBlanche and Mary.\_ They were all three of the loftiest stature of\nwomen.\_ The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was\nstill fine; her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth,\ntoo, were still apparently perfect.\_ Most people would have termed her a\nsplendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically\nspeaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable\nhaughtiness in her bearing and countenance.\_ She had Roman features and\na double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features\nappeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with\npride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position\nof almost preternatural erectness.\_ She had, likewise, a fierce and a\nhard eye: it reminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in\nspeaking; her voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very\ndogmatical,—very intolerable, in short.\_ A crimson velvet robe, and a\nshawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose\nshe thought) with a truly imperial dignity.\n\nBlanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars.\_\nMary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.\_\nI regarded her, of course, with special interest.\_ First, I wished to\nsee whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description;\nsecondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted\nof her; and thirdly—it will out!—whether it were such as I should fancy\nlikely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.\n\nAs far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture\nand Mrs. Fairfax’s description.\_ The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,\nthe graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but\nher face?\_ Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed\nlikeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.\_ It\nwas not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her\nlaugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched\nand haughty lip.\n\nGenius is said to be self-conscious.\_ I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram\nwas a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious\nindeed.\_ She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.\nDent.\_ It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she\nsaid, she liked flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and\nshe ran over its vocabulary with an air.\_ I presently perceived she was\n(what is vernacularly termed) trailing Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on\nher ignorance—her trail might be clever, but it was decidedly not\ngood-natured.\_ She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her\nvoice was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it\nwell, with fluency and with a good accent.\n\nMary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer\nfeatures too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a\nSpaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,\nher eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,\nremained fixed like a statue in its niche.\_ The sisters were both\nattired in spotless white.\n\nAnd did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be\nlikely to make?\_ I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female\nbeauty.\_ If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty:\nthen she was accomplished, sprightly.\_ Most gentlemen would admire her,\nI thought; and that he did admire her, I already seemed to have\nobtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to\nsee them together.\n\nYou are not to suppose, reader, that Adèle has all this time been\nsitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered,\nshe rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with\ngravity—\n\n“Bon jour, mesdames.”\n\nAnd Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and\nexclaimed, “Oh, what a little puppet!”\n\nLady Lynn had remarked, “It is Mr. Rochester’s ward, I suppose—the\nlittle French girl he was speaking of.”\n\nMrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.\n\nAmy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—“What a love of a\nchild!”\n\nAnd then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced\nbetween them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;\nabsorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton\nand Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart’s content.\n\nAt last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.\_ I sit in\nthe shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the\nwindow-curtain half hides me.\_ Again the arch yawns; they come.\_ The\ncollective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very\nimposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some\nyoung.\_ Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and\nColonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.\_ Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the\ndistrict, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and\nwhiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a\n“père noble de théâtre.”\_ Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;\nlike them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and\nlistless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of\nblood or vigour of brain.\n\nAnd where is Mr. Rochester?\n\nHe comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.\_ I\ntry to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes\nof the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my\nhands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;\nwhereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the\nmoment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he\ndeemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down\non my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager\nto overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.\_ How near had I approached\nhim at that moment!\_ What had occurred since, calculated to change his\nand my relative positions?\_ Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we\nwere!\_ So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to\nme.\_ I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at\nthe other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the\nladies.\n\nNo sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I\nmight gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily\nto his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,\nand the irids would fix on him.\_ I looked, and had an acute pleasure in\nlooking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely\npoint of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel\nwho knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and\ndrinks divine draughts nevertheless.\n\nMost true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.”\_ My master’s\ncolourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,\ndeep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision,\nwill,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than\nbeautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite\nmastered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them\nin his.\_ I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought\nhard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and\nnow, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green\nand strong!\_ He made me love him without looking at me.\n\nI compared him with his guests.\_ What was the gallant grace of the\nLynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military\ndistinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and\ngenuine power?\_ I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression:\nyet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive,\nhandsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once\nharsh-featured and melancholy-looking.\_ I saw them smile, laugh—it was\nnothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile;\nthe tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh.\_ I saw Mr.\nRochester smile:—his stern features softened; his eye grew both\nbrilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.\_ He was talking,\nat the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton.\_ I wondered to see them receive\nwith calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their\neyes to fall, their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found\nthey were in no sense moved.\_ “He is not to them what he is to me,” I\nthought: “he is not of their kind.\_ I believe he is of mine;—I am sure\nhe is—I feel akin to him—I understand the language of his countenance\nand movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something\nin my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me\nmentally to him.\_ Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do\nwith him but to receive my salary at his hands?\_ Did I forbid myself to\nthink of him in any other light than as a paymaster?\_ Blasphemy against\nnature!\_ Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively\nround him.\_ I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I\nmust remember that he cannot care much for me.\_ For when I say that I am\nof his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his\nspell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in\ncommon with him.\_ I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever\nsundered:—and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.”\n\nCoffee is handed.\_ The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become\nlively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.\_ Colonel Dent and\nMr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.\_ The two proud\ndowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.\_ Sir\nGeorge—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and\nvery fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,\ncoffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.\_ Mr. Frederick Lynn\nhas taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings\nof a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently\nsays little.\_ The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms\non the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at\nhim, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.\nRochester.\_ Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of\nLouisa: Adèle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,\nand Louisa laughs at his blunders.\_ With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?\_\nShe is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.\_\nShe seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she\nherself selects a mate.\n\nMr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as\nsolitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her\nstation on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?”\n\n“Nor am I.”\n\n“Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?”\n(pointing to Adèle).\_ “Where did you pick her up?”\n\n“I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.”\n\n“You should have sent her to school.”\n\n“I could not afford it: schools are so dear.”\n\n“Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her\njust now—is she gone?\_ Oh, no! there she is still, behind the\nwindow-curtain.\_ You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as\nexpensive,—more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.”\n\nI feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make Mr.\nRochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the\nshade: but he never turned his eyes.\n\n“I have not considered the subject,” said he indifferently, looking\nstraight before him.\n\n“No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.\_ You should\nhear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should\nthink, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest\nridiculous, and all incubi—were they not, mama?”\n\n“Did you speak, my own?”\n\nThe young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property,\nreiterated her question with an explanation.\n\n“My dearest, don’t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.\_ I\nhave suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.\_ I thank\nHeaven I have now done with them!”\n\nMrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in\nher ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one\nof the anathematised race was present.\n\n“Tant pis!” said her Ladyship, “I hope it may do her good!”\_ Then, in a\nlower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, “I noticed her; I am a\njudge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.”\n\n“What are they, madam?” inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.\n\n“I will tell you in your private ear,” replied she, wagging her turban\nthree times with portentous significancy.\n\n“But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.”\n\n“Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.”\n\n“Oh, don’t refer him to me, mama!\_ I have just one word to say of the\nwhole tribe; they are a nuisance.\_ Not that I ever suffered much from\nthem; I took care to turn the tables.\_ What tricks Theodore and I used\nto play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!\_ Mary\nwas always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.\_ The best fun was\nwith Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and\nlow-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs.\nGrey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.\_ But poor\nMadame Joubert!\_ I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had\ndriven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter,\ntossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the\nruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.\_ Theodore, do you remember\nthose merry days?”\n\n“Yaas, to be sure I do,” drawled Lord Ingram; “and the poor old stick\nused to cry out ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised her on\nthe presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,\nwhen she was herself so ignorant.”\n\n“We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or\npersecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as\nwe used to call him.\_ He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in\nlove with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry\ntender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la belle\npassion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our\ndiscovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights\nfrom the house.\_ Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the\nbusiness, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.\_ Did you not, my\nlady-mother?”\n\n“Certainly, my best.\_ And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a\nthousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should\nnever be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—”\n\n“Oh, gracious, mama!\_ Spare us the enumeration!\_ Au reste, we all\nknow them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions\nand consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual\nalliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence\naccompanying—mutiny and general blow-up.\_ Am I right, Baroness Ingram,\nof Ingram Park?”\n\n“My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.”\n\n“Then no more need be said: change the subject.”\n\nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her\nsoft, infantine tone: “Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but\nshe was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her\nout.\_ She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?”\n\n“No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her\nworkbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,\nshe would give us anything we asked for.”\n\n“I suppose, now,” said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, “we\nshall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in\norder to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new\ntopic.\_ Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?”\n\n“Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.”\n\n“Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.\_ Signior Eduardo, are\nyou in voice to-night?”\n\n“Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.”\n\n“Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your\nlungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal\nservice.”\n\n“Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?”\n\n“A fig for Rizzio!” cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as\nshe moved to the piano.\_ “It is my opinion the fiddler David must have\nbeen an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind\na man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may\nsay what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the\nsort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift\nwith my hand.”\n\n“Gentlemen, you hear!\_ Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?” cried\nMr. Rochester.\n\n“I should say the preference lies with you,” responded Colonel Dent.\n\n“On my honour, I am much obliged to you,” was the reply.\n\nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,\nspreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a\nbrilliant prelude; talking meantime.\_ She appeared to be on her high\nhorse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not\nonly the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was\nevidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring\nindeed.\n\n“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed she,\nrattling away at the instrument.\_ “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a\nstep beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama’s\npermission and guardianship!\_ Creatures so absorbed in care about their\npretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man\nhad anything to do with beauty!\_ As if loveliness were not the special\nprerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage!\_ I grant an\nugly woman is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the\ngentlemen, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and\nvalour: let their motto be:—Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not\nworth a fillip.\_ Such should be my device, were I a man.”\n\n“Whenever I marry,” she continued after a pause which none interrupted,\n“I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.\_ I\nwill suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided\nhomage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he\nsees in his mirror.\_ Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.”\n\n“I am all obedience,” was the response.\n\n“Here then is a Corsair-song.\_ Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for\nthat reason, sing it con spirito.”\n\n“Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk\nand water.”\n\n“Take care, then: if you don’t please me, I will shame you by showing\nhow such things should be done.”\n\n“That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to\nfail.”\n\n“Gardez-vous en bien!\_ If you err wilfully, I shall devise a\nproportionate punishment.”\n\n“Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict\na chastisement beyond mortal endurance.”\n\n“Ha! explain!” commanded the lady.\n\n“Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must\ninform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for\ncapital punishment.”\n\n“Sing!” said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an\naccompaniment in spirited style.\n\n“Now is my time to slip away,” thought I: but the tones that then\nsevered the air arrested me.\_ Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester\npossessed a fine voice: he did—a mellow, powerful bass, into which he\nthrew his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to\nthe heart, and there waking sensation strangely.\_ I waited till the last\ndeep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an\ninstant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and\nmade my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.\_ Thence a\nnarrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal\nwas loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the\nmat at the foot of the staircase.\_ I heard the dining-room door unclose;\na gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it\nwas Mr. Rochester.\n\n“How do you do?” he asked.\n\n“I am very well, sir.”\n\n“Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?”\n\nI thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I\nwould not take that freedom.\_ I answered—\n\n“I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.”\n\n“What have you been doing during my absence?”\n\n“Nothing particular; teaching Adèle as usual.”\n\n“And getting a good deal paler than you were—as I saw at first sight.\_\nWhat is the matter?”\n\n“Nothing at all, sir.”\n\n“Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?”\n\n“Not the least.”\n\n“Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.”\n\n“I am tired, sir.”\n\nHe looked at me for a minute.\n\n“And a little depressed,” he said.\_ “What about?\_ Tell me.”\n\n“Nothing—nothing, sir.\_ I am not depressed.”\n\n“But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words\nwould bring tears to your eyes—indeed, they are there now, shining and\nswimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the\nflag.\_ If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig\nof a servant passing, I would know what all this means.\_ Well, to-night\nI excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect\nyou to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don’t\nneglect it.\_ Now go, and send Sophie for Adèle.\_ Good-night, my—”\_ He\nstopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.\n"
