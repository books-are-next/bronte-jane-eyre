title: "\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThe more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.\_\nIn a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all\nday, and walk out sometimes.\_ I could join with Diana and Mary in all\ntheir occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid\nthem when and where they would allow me.\_ There was a reviving pleasure\nin this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the\npleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and\nprinciples.\n\nI liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted\nme; what they approved, I reverenced.\_ They loved their sequestered\nhome.\_ I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof,\nits latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged\nfirs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden,\ndark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest species\nwould bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent.\_ They clung to the\npurple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale into\nwhich the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and\nwhich wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the\nwildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,\nor gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little\nmossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect\nenthusiasm of attachment.\_ I could comprehend the feeling, and share\nboth its strength and truth.\_ I saw the fascination of the locality.\_ I\nfelt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline\nof swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell\nby moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,\nand mellow granite crag.\_ These details were just to me what they were\nto them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.\_ The strong blast\nand the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise\nand sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in\nthese regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my faculties\nthe same spell that entranced theirs.\n\nIndoors we agreed equally well.\_ They were both more accomplished and\nbetter read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of\nknowledge they had trodden before me.\_ I devoured the books they lent\nme: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening\nwhat I had perused during the day.\_ Thought fitted thought; opinion met\nopinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.\n\nIf in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.\_\nPhysically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.\_ In\nher animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,\nsuch as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.\_ I could\ntalk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity\nand fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s feet, to rest\nmy head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they\nsounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.\_ Diana offered\nto teach me German.\_ I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of\ninstructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited\nme no less.\_ Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection—of the strongest\nkind—was the result.\_ They discovered I could draw: their pencils and\ncolour-boxes were immediately at my service.\_ My skill, greater in this\none point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.\_ Mary would sit and\nwatch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a\ndocile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.\_ Thus occupied, and\nmutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.\n\nAs to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and\nrapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him.\_ One reason of\nthe distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively\nseldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to\nvisiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.\n\nNo weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or\nfair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,\nand, followed by his father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission\nof love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.\_\nSometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would\nexpostulate.\_ He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than\ncheerful—\n\n“And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from\nthese easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I\npropose to myself?”\n\nDiana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some\nminutes of apparently mournful meditation.\n\nBut besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to\nfriendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of\na brooding nature.\_ Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his\nlife and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,\nthat inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere\nChristian and practical philanthropist.\_ Often, of an evening, when he\nsat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease\nreading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to\nI know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and\nexciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of\nhis eye.\n\nI think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight\nit was to his sisters.\_ He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a\nstrong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection\nfor the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more\nof gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was\nmanifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of\ntheir soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the thousand\npeaceful delights they could yield.\n\nIncommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity\nof gauging his mind.\_ I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard\nhim preach in his own church at Morton.\_ I wish I could describe that\nsermon: but it is past my power.\_ I cannot even render faithfully the\neffect it produced on me.\n\nIt began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it\nwas calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal\nbreathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous\nlanguage.\_ This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled.\_ The\nheart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher:\nneither were softened.\_ Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an\nabsence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic\ndoctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each\nreference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.\_\nWhen he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by\nhis discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to\nme—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to which I\nhad been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of\ndisappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and\ndisquieting aspirations.\_ I was sure St. John Rivers—pure-lived,\nconscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found that peace of God\nwhich passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought,\nthan had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and\nlost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but\nwhich possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.\n\nMeantime a month was gone.\_ Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor\nHouse, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited\nthem, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,\nwhere each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty\nmembers they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither\nknew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their\nacquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or\nthe taste of their waiting-woman.\_ Mr. St. John had said nothing to me\nyet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became\nurgent that I should have a vocation of some kind.\_ One morning, being\nleft alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach\nthe window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind\nof study—and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what\nwords to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times difficult to break the\nice of reserve glassing over such natures as his—when he saved me the\ntrouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.\n\nLooking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.\n\n“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer\nmyself to undertake?”\n\n“I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed\nboth useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become attached\nto you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed it\ninexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching\ndeparture from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”\n\n“And they will go in three days now?” I said.\n\n“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:\nHannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”\n\nI waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first\nbroached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his\nlook denoted abstraction from me and my business.\_ I was obliged to\nrecall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious\ninterest to me.\n\n“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?\_ I hope this delay\nwill not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”\n\n“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and\nyou to accept.”\n\nHe again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.\_ I grew\nimpatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance\nfastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as\nwords could have done, and with less trouble.\n\n“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I\nhave nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.\_ Before I explain,\nrecall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,\nit must be as the blind man would help the lame.\_ I am poor; for I find\nthat, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining to\nme will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and\nthe patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in\nfront.\_ I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole\ndescendants of the race, two earn the dependant’s crust among strangers,\nand the third considers himself an alien from his native country—not\nonly for life, but in death.\_ Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem,\nhimself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the\ncross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders,\nand when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he\nis one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”\n\nSt. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,\ndeep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of\nglance.\_ He resumed—\n\n“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service\nof poverty and obscurity.\_ You may even think it degrading—for I see\nnow your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean\nto the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated;\nbut I consider that no service degrades which can better our race.\_ I\nhold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian\nlabourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the meed his\ntoil brings—the higher the honour.\_ His, under such circumstances, is\nthe destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were\nthe Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.”\n\n“Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”\n\nHe looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read\nmy face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.\_ The\nconclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his\nsucceeding observations.\n\n“I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it\nfor a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently\nkeep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English\ncountry incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to\nrepose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”\n\n“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.\n\n“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how\ncramping.\_ I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,\nand that I am my own master.\_ I shall leave the place probably in the\ncourse of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to\nthe utmost for its improvement.\_ Morton, when I came to it two years\nago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every\nhope of progress.\_ I established one for boys: I mean now to open a\nsecond school for girls.\_ I have hired a building for the purpose, with\na cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house.\_ Her\nsalary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,\nvery simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;\nthe only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the\nproprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley.\_ The same\nlady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the\nworkhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial\noffices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of\nteaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.\_ Will you\nbe this mistress?”\n\nHe put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an\nindignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing\nall my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in\nwhat light the lot would appear to me.\_ In truth it was humble—but then\nit was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but then,\ncompared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;\nand the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it\nwas not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I made my decision.\n\n“I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my\nheart.”\n\n“But you comprehend me?” he said.\_ “It is a village school: your\nscholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best,\nfarmers’ daughters.\_ Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will\nbe all you will have to teach.\_ What will you do with your\naccomplishments?\_ What, with the largest portion of your\nmind—sentiments—tastes?”\n\n“Save them till they are wanted.\_ They will keep.”\n\n“You know what you undertake, then?”\n\n“I do.”\n\nHe now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and\ndeeply gratified.\n\n“And when will you commence the exercise of your function?”\n\n“I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next\nweek.”\n\n“Very well: so be it.”\n\nHe rose and walked through the room.\_ Standing still, he again looked at\nme.\_ He shook his head.\n\n“What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?” I asked.\n\n“You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!”\n\n“Why?\_ What is your reason for saying so?”\n\n“I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the\nmaintenance of an even tenor in life.”\n\n“I am not ambitious.”\n\nHe started at the word “ambitious.”\_ He repeated, “No.\_ What made you\nthink of ambition?\_ Who is ambitious?\_ I know I am: but how did you find\nit out?”\n\n“I was speaking of myself.”\n\n“Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—”\_ He paused.\n\n“What?”\n\n“I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have\nmisunderstood the word, and been displeased.\_ I mean, that human\naffections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.\_ I am sure\nyou cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to\ndevote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of\nstimulus: any more than I can be content,” he added, with emphasis, “to\nlive here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God\ngave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made\nuseless.\_ You hear now how I contradict myself.\_ I, who preached\ncontentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers\nof wood and drawers of water in God’s service—I, His ordained minister,\nalmost rave in my restlessness.\_ Well, propensities and principles must\nbe reconciled by some means.”\n\nHe left the room.\_ In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in\nthe whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.\n\nDiana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached\nfor leaving their brother and their home.\_ They both tried to appear as\nusual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could\nnot be entirely conquered or concealed.\_ Diana intimated that this would\nbe a different parting from any they had ever yet known.\_ It would\nprobably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it\nmight be a parting for life.\n\n“He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,” she said: “natural\naffection and feelings more potent still.\_ St. John looks quiet, Jane;\nbut he hides a fever in his vitals.\_ You would think him gentle, yet in\nsome things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my\nconscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe\ndecision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.\_ It is\nright, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!”\_ And the tears gushed\nto her fine eyes.\_ Mary bent her head low over her work.\n\n“We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,”\nshe murmured.\n\nAt that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by\nfate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that “misfortunes never\ncome singly,” and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip\nbetween the cup and the lip.\_ St. John passed the window reading a\nletter.\_ He entered.\n\n“Our uncle John is dead,” said he.\n\nBoth the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings\nappeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.\n\n“Dead?” repeated Diana.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe riveted a searching gaze on her brother’s face.\_ “And what then?”\nshe demanded, in a low voice.\n\n“What then, Die?” he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of\nfeature.\_ “What then?\_ Why—nothing.\_ Read.”\n\nHe threw the letter into her lap.\_ She glanced over it, and handed it to\nMary.\_ Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.\_ All\nthree looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive smile\nenough.\n\n“Amen!\_ We can yet live,” said Diana at last.\n\n“At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,” remarked\nMary.\n\n“Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might\nhave been,” said Mr. Rivers, “and contrasts it somewhat too vividly\nwith what is.”\n\nHe folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.\n\nFor some minutes no one spoke.\_ Diana then turned to me.\n\n“Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,” she said, “and think us\nhard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a\nrelation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.\_ He was\nmy mother’s brother.\_ My father and he quarrelled long ago.\_ It was by\nhis advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation\nthat ruined him.\_ Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted\nin anger, and were never reconciled.\_ My uncle engaged afterwards in\nmore prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty\nthousand pounds.\_ He was never married, and had no near kindred but\nourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.\_ My\nfather always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by\nleaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has\nbequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of\nthirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,\nfor the purchase of three mourning rings.\_ He had a right, of course, to\ndo as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the\nreceipt of such news.\_ Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich\nwith a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been\nvaluable, for the good it would have enabled him to do.”\n\nThis explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further\nreference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.\_ The next day\nI left Marsh End for Morton.\_ The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it\nfor distant B-.\_ In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the\nparsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.\n"
