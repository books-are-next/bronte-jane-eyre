title: "\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nEre the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and\nall were gone into the refectory to tea.\_ I now ventured to descend: it\nwas deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.\_ The\nspell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction\ntook place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I\nsank prostrate with my face to the ground.\_ Now I wept: Helen Burns was\nnot here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and\nmy tears watered the boards.\_ I had meant to be so good, and to do so\nmuch at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win\naffection.\_ Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had\nreached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss\nTemple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and\nto let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two\nmonths longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated\nas an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I\nlay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?\n\n“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die.\_ While sobbing out\nthis wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again\nHelen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the\nlong, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.\n\n“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as\nif a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.\_\nHelen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my\nagitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.\_ She sat down\non the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her\nhead upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.\_ I\nwas the first who spoke—\n\n“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a\nliar?”\n\n“Everybody, Jane?\_ Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you\ncalled so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.”\n\n“But what have I to do with millions?\_ The eighty, I know, despise me.”\n\n“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises\nor dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.”\n\n“How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?”\n\n“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:\nhe is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.\_ Had\nhe treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,\ndeclared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would\noffer you sympathy if they dared.\_ Teachers and pupils may look coldly\non you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their\nhearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long\nappear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.\_\nBesides, Jane”—she paused.\n\n“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers\ngently to warm them, and went on—\n\n“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own\nconscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be\nwithout friends.”\n\n“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if\nothers don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be\nsolitary and hated, Helen.\_ Look here; to gain some real affection from\nyou, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly\nsubmit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or\nto stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—”\n\n“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too\nimpulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and\nput life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble\nself, or than creatures feeble as you.\_ Besides this earth, and besides\nthe race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:\nthat world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch\nus, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain\nand shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels\nsee our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know\nyou are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously\nrepeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in\nyour ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the\nseparation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.\_ Why,\nthen, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so\nsoon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to glory?”\n\nI was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted\nthere was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.\_ I felt the impression of\nwoe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having\ndone speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I\nmomentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\n\nResting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she\ndrew me to her, and we reposed in silence.\_ We had not sat long thus,\nwhen another person came in.\_ Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a\nrising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through\na window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure,\nwhich we at once recognised as Miss Temple.\n\n“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she; “I want you in my\nroom; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.”\n\nWe went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some\nintricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her\napartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.\_ Miss Temple\ntold Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the\nhearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.\n\n“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face.\_ “Have you cried\nyour grief away?”\n\n“I am afraid I never shall do that.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody\nelse, will now think me wicked.”\n\n“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.\_ Continue\nto act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.”\n\n“Shall I, Miss Temple?”\n\n“You will,” said she, passing her arm round me.\_ “And now tell me who is\nthe lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”\n\n“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife.\_ My uncle is dead, and he left me to her\ncare.”\n\n“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”\n\n“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have\noften heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she\nwould always keep me.”\n\n“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a\ncriminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.\_\nYou have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as\nyou can.\_ Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and\nexaggerate nothing.”\n\nI resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate—most\ncorrect; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange\ncoherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad\nchildhood.\_ Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it\ngenerally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen’s\nwarnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the\nnarrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.\_ Thus restrained\nand simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss\nTemple fully believed me.\n\nIn the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to\nsee me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode\nof the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some\ndegree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the\nspasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild\nsupplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and\nhaunted chamber.\n\nI had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she\nthen said—\n\n“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply\nagrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every\nimputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.”\n\nShe kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well\ncontented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the\ncontemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her\nwhite forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes),\nshe proceeded to address Helen Burns.\n\n“How are you to-night, Helen?\_ Have you coughed much to-day?”\n\n“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”\n\n“And the pain in your chest?”\n\n“It is a little better.”\n\nMiss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she\nreturned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.\_ She\nwas pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—\n\n“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.”\_ She\nrang her bell.\n\n“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered it, “I have not yet had\ntea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.”\n\nAnd a tray was soon brought.\_ How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups\nand bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!\_\nHow fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!\nof which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)\ndiscerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\n\n“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and butter?\_\nThere is not enough for three.”\n\nBarbara went out: she returned soon—\n\n“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.”\n\nMrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\nBrocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\n\n“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Barbara, I\nsuppose.”\_ And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I\nhave it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”\n\nHaving invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before\neach of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she\ngot up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,\ndisclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\n\n“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she,\n“but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she\nproceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.\n\nWe feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least\ndelight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which\nour hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the\ndelicate fare she liberally supplied.\n\nTea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat\none on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and\nHelen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.\n\nMiss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her\nmien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation\ninto the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the\npleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a\ncontrolling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen\nBurns, I was struck with wonder.\n\nThe refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of\nher beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in\nher own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.\_ They woke, they\nkindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till\nthis hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in\nthe liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more\nsingular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine colour nor\nlong eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of\nradiance.\_ Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what\nsource I cannot tell.\_ Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,\nvigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid\neloquence?\_ Such was the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to\nme, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very\nbrief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.\n\nThey conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times\npast; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed\nat: they spoke of books: how many they had read!\_ What stores of\nknowledge they possessed!\_ Then they seemed so familiar with French\nnames and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss\nTemple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the\nLatin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade\nher read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of\nveneration expanding at every sounding line.\_ She had scarcely finished\nere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple\nembraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—\n\n“God bless you, my children!”\n\nHelen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;\nit was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second\ntime breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.\n\nOn reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was\nexamining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns’s, and when we\nentered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that\nto-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles\npinned to her shoulder.\n\n“My things were indeed in shameful disorder,” murmured Helen to me, in a\nlow voice: “I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.”\n\nNext morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece\nof pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and bound it like a phylactery round\nHelen’s large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.\_ She wore\nit till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved\npunishment.\_ The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,\nI ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of\nwhich she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,\nhot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle\nof her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.\n\nAbout a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,\nwho had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what\nhe said went to corroborate my account.\_ Miss Temple, having assembled\nthe whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges\nalleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to\npronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.\_ The teachers\nthen shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran\nthrough the ranks of my companions.\n\nThus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,\nresolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and\nmy success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally\ntenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few\nweeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was\nallowed to commence French and drawing.\_ I learned the first two tenses\nof the verb Etre, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,\nby-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on\nthe same day.\_ That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in\nimagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread\nand new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I\nfeasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the\ndark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,\npicturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings\nof butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe\ncherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with\nyoung ivy sprays.\_ I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my\never being able to translate currently a certain little French story\nwhich Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved\nto my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.\n\nWell has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a\nstalled ox and hatred therewith.”\n\nI would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for\nGateshead and its daily luxuries.\n"
