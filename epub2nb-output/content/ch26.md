title: "\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAs I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if\nit were a dream.\_ I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen\nMr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.\n\nWhile arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it\nwas no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its\ncolour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition,\nand borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.\_ I had often been unwilling\nto look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my\nlook; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his\naffection by its expression.\_ I took a plain but clean and light summer\ndress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well\nbecome me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.\n\nI was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a\nbrilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to\nfeel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant\nbreeze.\_ Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.\_ A beggar-woman\nand her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming up the walk,\nand I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my\npurse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my\njubilee.\_ The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so\nmerry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.\n\nMrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad\ncountenance, and saying gravely—“Miss Eyre, will you come to\nbreakfast?”\_ During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not\nundeceive her then.\_ I must wait for my master to give explanations; and\nso must she.\_ I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.\_ I met\nAdèle leaving the schoolroom.\n\n“Where are you going?\_ It is time for lessons.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.”\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“In there,” pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and\nthere he stood.\n\n“Come and bid me good-morning,” said he.\_ I gladly advanced; and it was\nnot merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,\nbut an embrace and a kiss.\_ It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so\nwell loved, so caressed by him.\n\n“Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,” said he: “truly\npretty this morning.\_ Is this my pale, little elf?\_ Is this my\nmustard-seed?\_ This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and\nrosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?”\_ (I\nhad green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they\nwere new-dyed, I suppose.)\n\n“It is Jane Eyre, sir.”\n\n“Soon to be Jane Rochester,” he added: “in four weeks, Janet; not a day\nmore.\_ Do you hear that?”\n\nI did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.\_ The\nfeeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than\nwas consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned.\_ It was, I\nthink almost fear.\n\n“You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?”\n\n“Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems so\nstrange.”\n\n“Yes, Mrs. Rochester,” said he; “young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax\nRochester’s girl-bride.”\n\n“It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.\_ Human beings never\nenjoy complete happiness in this world.\_ I was not born for a different\ndestiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is\na fairy tale—a day-dream.”\n\n“Which I can and will realise.\_ I shall begin to-day.\_ This morning I\nwrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his\nkeeping,—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.\_ In a day or two I hope\nto pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall\nbe yours that I would accord a peer’s daughter, if about to marry her.”\n\n“Oh, sir!—never rain jewels!\_ I don’t like to hear them spoken of.\_\nJewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not\nhave them.”\n\n“I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on\nyour forehead,—which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped\nher patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the\nbracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with\nrings.”\n\n“No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in\nanother strain.\_ Don’t address me as if I were a beauty; I am your\nplain, Quakerish governess.”\n\n“You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my\nheart,—delicate and aërial.”\n\n“Puny and insignificant, you mean.\_ You are dreaming, sir,—or you are\nsneering.\_ For God’s sake don’t be ironical!”\n\n“I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,” he went on, while\nI really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he\nwas either deluding himself or trying to delude me.\_ “I will attire my\nJane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will\ncover the head I love best with a priceless veil.”\n\n“And then you won’t know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any\nlonger, but an ape in a harlequin’s jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes.\_ I\nwould as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as\nmyself clad in a court-lady’s robe; and I don’t call you handsome, sir,\nthough I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.\_ Don’t\nflatter me.”\n\nHe pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.\_ “This\nvery day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must\nchoose some dresses for yourself.\_ I told you we shall be married in\nfour weeks.\_ The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down\nbelow yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.\_ After a\nbrief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to\nFrench vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is\nfamous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the\nlife of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison\nwith others.”\n\n“Shall I travel?—and with you, sir?”\n\n“You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and\nVienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:\nwherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph’s foot shall step also.\_ Ten\nyears since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and\nrage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with\na very angel as my comforter.”\n\nI laughed at him as he said this.\_ “I am not an angel,” I asserted; “and\nI will not be one till I die: I will be myself.\_ Mr. Rochester, you must\nneither expect nor exact anything celestial of me—for you will not get\nit, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all\nanticipate.”\n\n“What do you anticipate of me?”\n\n“For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,—a very little\nwhile; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and\nthen you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but\nwhen you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,—like\nme, I say, not love me.\_ I suppose your love will effervesce in six\nmonths, or less.\_ I have observed in books written by men, that period\nassigned as the farthest to which a husband’s ardour extends.\_ Yet,\nafter all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite\ndistasteful to my dear master.”\n\n“Distasteful! and like you again!\_ I think I shall like you again, and\nyet again: and I will make you confess I do not only like, but\nlove you—with truth, fervour, constancy.”\n\n“Yet are you not capricious, sir?”\n\n“To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I\nfind out they have neither souls nor hearts—when they open to me a\nperspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,\nand ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul\nmade of fire, and the character that bends but does not break—at once\nsupple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever tender and true.”\n\n“Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?\_ Did you ever love\nsuch an one?”\n\n“I love it now.”\n\n“But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult\nstandard?”\n\n“I never met your likeness.\_ Jane, you please me, and you master me—you\nseem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I\nam twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up\nmy arm to my heart.\_ I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is\nsweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery\nbeyond any triumph I can win.\_ Why do you smile, Jane?\_ What does that\ninexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?”\n\n“I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I\nwas thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers—”\n\n“You were, you little elfish—”\n\n“Hush, sir!\_ You don’t talk very wisely just now; any more than those\ngentlemen acted very wisely.\_ However, had they been married, they would\nno doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness\nas suitors; and so will you, I fear.\_ I wonder how you will answer me a\nyear hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or\npleasure to grant.”\n\n“Ask me something now, Jane,—the least thing: I desire to be entreated—”\n\n“Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.”\n\n“Speak!\_ But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall\nswear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of\nme.”\n\n“Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don’t send for the jewels, and don’t\ncrown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round\nthat plain pocket handkerchief you have there.”\n\n“I might as well ‘gild refined gold.’\_ I know it: your request is\ngranted then—for the time.\_ I will remand the order I despatched to my\nbanker.\_ But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift\nto be withdrawn: try again.”\n\n“Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is\nmuch piqued on one point.”\n\nHe looked disturbed.\_ “What? what?” he said hastily.\_ “Curiosity is a\ndangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every\nrequest—”\n\n“But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.”\n\n“Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into,\nperhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.”\n\n“Now, King Ahasuerus!\_ What do I want with half your estate?\_ Do you\nthink I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?\_ I would much\nrather have all your confidence.\_ You will not exclude me from your\nconfidence if you admit me to your heart?”\n\n“You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but\nfor God’s sake, don’t desire a useless burden!\_ Don’t long for\npoison—don’t turn out a downright Eve on my hands!”\n\n“Why not, sir?\_ You have just been telling me how much you liked to be\nconquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.\_ Don’t you think\nI had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and\nentreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay\nof my power?”\n\n“I dare you to any such experiment.\_ Encroach, presume, and the game is\nup.”\n\n“Is it, sir?\_ You soon give in.\_ How stern you look now!\_ Your eyebrows\nhave become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in\nsome very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled\nthunderloft.’\_ That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?”\n\n“If that will be your married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give\nup the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.\_ But what\nhad you to ask, thing,—out with it?”\n\n“There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal\nbetter than flattery.\_ I had rather be a thing than an angel.\_ This is\nwhat I have to ask,—Why did you take such pains to make me believe you\nwished to marry Miss Ingram?”\n\n“Is that all?\_ Thank God it is no worse!”\_ And now he unknit his black\nbrows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well\npleased at seeing a danger averted.\_ “I think I may confess,” he\ncontinued, “even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane—and\nI have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.\_ You\nglowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,\nand claimed your rank as my equal.\_ Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who\nmade me the offer.”\n\n“Of course I did.\_ But to the point if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?”\n\n“Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render\nyou as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy\nwould be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.”\n\n“Excellent!\_ Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of my\nlittle finger.\_ It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act\nin that way.\_ Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram’s feelings, sir?”\n\n“Her feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humbling.\_\nWere you jealous, Jane?”\n\n“Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know\nthat.\_ Answer me truly once more.\_ Do you think Miss Ingram will not\nsuffer from your dishonest coquetry?\_ Won’t she feel forsaken and\ndeserted?”\n\n“Impossible!—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the\nidea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a\nmoment.”\n\n“You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.\_ I am afraid your\nprinciples on some points are eccentric.”\n\n“My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little\nawry for want of attention.”\n\n“Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been\nvouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the\nbitter pain I myself felt a while ago?”\n\n“That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the\nworld has the same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant\nunction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.”\n\nI turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.\_ I loved him very\nmuch—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words had power to\nexpress.\n\n“Ask something more,” he said presently; “it is my delight to be\nentreated, and to yield.”\n\nI was again ready with my request.\_ “Communicate your intentions to Mrs.\nFairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was\nshocked.\_ Give her some explanation before I see her again.\_ It pains me\nto be misjudged by so good a woman.”\n\n“Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,” he replied.\_ “I mean you to\naccompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the\ndrive, I will enlighten the old lady’s understanding.\_ Did she think,\nJanet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?”\n\n“I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.”\n\n“Station! station!—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of\nthose who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go.”\n\nI was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax’s\nparlour, I hurried down to it.\_ The old lady, had been reading her\nmorning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open\nbefore her, and her spectacles were upon it.\_ Her occupation, suspended\nby Mr. Rochester’s announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed\non the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind\nstirred by unwonted tidings.\_ Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a\nsort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but\nthe smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.\_ She put\nup her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the\ntable.\n\n“I feel so astonished,” she began, “I hardly know what to say to you,\nMiss Eyre.\_ I have surely not been dreaming, have I?\_ Sometimes I half\nfall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never\nhappened.\_ It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a\ndoze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in\nand sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my\nname, Alice, as he used to do.\_ Now, can you tell me whether it is\nactually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?\_ Don’t\nlaugh at me.\_ But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and\nsaid that in a month you would be his wife.”\n\n“He has said the same thing to me,” I replied.\n\n“He has!\_ Do you believe him?\_ Have you accepted him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe looked at me bewildered.\_ “I could never have thought it.\_ He is a\nproud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least,\nliked money.\_ He, too, has always been called careful.\_ He means to\nmarry you?”\n\n“He tells me so.”\n\nShe surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there\nfound no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.\n\n“It passes me!” she continued; “but no doubt, it is true since you say\nso.\_ How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don’t know.\_ Equality\nof position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are\ntwenty years of difference in your ages.\_ He might almost be your\nfather.”\n\n“No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!” exclaimed I, nettled; “he is nothing like my\nfather!\_ No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.\_\nMr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at\nfive-and-twenty.”\n\n“Is it really for love he is going to marry you?” she asked.\n\nI was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my\neyes.\n\n“I am sorry to grieve you,” pursued the widow; “but you are so young,\nand so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.\_\nIt is an old saying that ‘all is not gold that glitters;’ and in this\ncase I do fear there will be something found to be different to what\neither you or I expect.”\n\n“Why?—am I a monster?” I said: “is it impossible that Mr. Rochester\nshould have a sincere affection for me?”\n\n“No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I\ndaresay, is fond of you.\_ I have always noticed that you were a sort of\npet of his.\_ There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little\nuneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your\nguard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.\_ I\nknew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so\ndiscreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be\ntrusted to protect yourself.\_ Last night I cannot tell you what I\nsuffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,\nnor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in with\nhim.”\n\n“Well, never mind that now,” I interrupted impatiently; “it is enough\nthat all was right.”\n\n“I hope all will be right in the end,” she said: “but believe me, you\ncannot be too careful.\_ Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:\ndistrust yourself as well as him.\_ Gentlemen in his station are not\naccustomed to marry their governesses.”\n\nI was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.\n\n“Let me go,—let me go to Millcote too!” she cried.\_ “Mr. Rochester\nwon’t: though there is so much room in the new carriage.\_ Beg him to let\nme go mademoiselle.”\n\n“That I will, Adèle;” and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my\ngloomy monitress.\_ The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round\nto the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him\nbackwards and forwards.\n\n“Adèle may accompany us, may she not, sir?”\n\n“I told her no.\_ I’ll have no brats!—I’ll have only you.”\n\n“Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.”\n\n“Not it: she will be a restraint.”\n\nHe was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.\_ The chill of Mrs.\nFairfax’s warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something\nof unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.\_ I half lost the\nsense of power over him.\_ I was about mechanically to obey him, without\nfurther remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked\nat my face.\n\n“What is the matter?” he asked; “all the sunshine is gone.\_ Do you\nreally wish the bairn to go?\_ Will it annoy you if she is left behind?”\n\n“I would far rather she went, sir.”\n\n“Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!” cried he\nto Adèle.\n\nShe obeyed him with what speed she might.\n\n“After all, a single morning’s interruption will not matter much,” said\nhe, “when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and\ncompany—for life.”\n\nAdèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her\ngratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a\ncorner on the other side of him.\_ She then peeped round to where I sat;\nso stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present\nfractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any\ninformation.\n\n“Let her come to me,” I entreated: “she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:\nthere is plenty of room on this side.”\n\nHe handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.\_ “I’ll send her to\nschool yet,” he said, but now he was smiling.\n\nAdèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school “sans\nmademoiselle?”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take\nmademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the\nwhite valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with\nme there, and only me.”\n\n“She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,” observed Adèle.\n\n“I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and\nhillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle.”\n\n“She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?”\n\n“Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I’ll carry her\nup to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.”\n\n“Oh, qu’ elle y sera mal—peu comfortable!\_ And her clothes, they will\nwear out: how can she get new ones?”\n\nMr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.\_ “Hem!” said he.\_ “What would you\ndo, Adèle?\_ Cudgel your brains for an expedient.\_ How would a white or a\npink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?\_ And one could cut a pretty\nenough scarf out of a rainbow.”\n\n“She is far better as she is,” concluded Adèle, after musing some time:\n“besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.\_ If I\nwere mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.”\n\n“She has consented: she has pledged her word.”\n\n“But you can’t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all\nair; and neither you nor she can fly.”\n\n“Adèle, look at that field.”\_ We were now outside Thornfield gates, and\nbowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was\nwell laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty\ntimber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.\n\n“In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight\nsince—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard\nmeadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me\non a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began\nto write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had\nfor happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight\nwas fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped\ntwo yards off me.\_ I looked at it.\_ It was a little thing with a veil of\ngossamer on its head.\_ I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at\nmy knee.\_ I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I\nread its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this\neffect—\n\n“It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to\nmake me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely\nplace—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her\nhorn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver\nvale where we might live.\_ I said I should like to go; but reminded it,\nas you did me, that I had no wings to fly.\n\n“‘Oh,’ returned the fairy, ‘that does not signify!\_ Here is a talisman\nwill remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring.\_\n‘Put it,’ she said, ‘on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am\nyours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own\nheaven yonder.’\_ She nodded again at the moon.\_ The ring, Adèle, is in\nmy breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon\nto change it to a ring again.”\n\n“But what has mademoiselle to do with it?\_ I don’t care for the fairy:\nyou said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?”\n\n“Mademoiselle is a fairy,” he said, whispering mysteriously.\_ Whereupon\nI told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a\nfund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester “un vrai\nmenteur,” and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his\n“contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand\nmême il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to him, nor\never give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.\n\nThe hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.\_ Mr.\nRochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was\nordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.\_ I hated the business, I begged\nleave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now.\_ By dint of\nentreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to\ntwo: these however, he vowed he would select himself.\_ With anxiety I\nwatched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the\nmost brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.\_ I told him in a\nnew series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a\nsilver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his\nchoice.\_ With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I\npersuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and\npearl-grey silk.\_ “It might pass for the present,” he said; “but he\nwould yet see me glittering like a parterre.”\n\nGlad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a\njewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a\nsense of annoyance and degradation.\_ As we re-entered the carriage, and\nI sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of\nevents, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle,\nJohn Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his\nlegatee.\_ “It would, indeed, be a relief,” I thought, “if I had ever so\nsmall an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.\nRochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling\ndaily round me.\_ I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell\nmy uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a\nprospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I\ncould better endure to be kept by him now.”\_ And somewhat relieved by\nthis idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more\nto meet my master’s and lover’s eye, which most pertinaciously sought\nmine, though I averted both face and gaze.\_ He smiled; and I thought his\nsmile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow\non a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was\never hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the\npassionate pressure.\n\n“You need not look in that way,” I said; “if you do, I’ll wear nothing\nbut my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.\_ I’ll be married in\nthis lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the\npearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black\nsatin.”\n\nHe chuckled; he rubbed his hands.\_ “Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?”\nhe exclaimed.\_ “Is she original?\_ Is she piquant?\_ I would not exchange\nthis one little English girl for the Grand Turk’s whole seraglio,\ngazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!”\n\nThe Eastern allusion bit me again.\_ “I’ll not stand you an inch in the\nstead of a seraglio,” I said; “so don’t consider me an equivalent for\none.\_ If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,\nto the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive\nslave-purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend\nsatisfactorily here.”\n\n“And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of\nflesh and such an assortment of black eyes?”\n\n“I’ll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to\nthem that are enslaved—your harem inmates amongst the rest.\_ I’ll get\nadmitted there, and I’ll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as\nyou are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:\nnor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a\ncharter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred.”\n\n“I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.”\n\n“I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an\neye like that.\_ While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever\ncharter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,\nwould be to violate its conditions.”\n\n“Why, Jane, what would you have?\_ I fear you will compel me to go\nthrough a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the\naltar.\_ You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they\nbe?”\n\n“I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.\_ Do\nyou remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the\ncashmeres you gave her?\_ I will not be your English Céline Varens.\_ I\nshall continue to act as Adèle’s governess; by that I shall earn my\nboard and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.\_ I’ll furnish my\nown wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but—”\n\n“Well, but what?”\n\n“Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.”\n\n“Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven’t your\nequal,” said he.\_ We were now approaching Thornfield.\_ “Will it please\nyou to dine with me to-day?” he asked, as we re-entered the gates.\n\n“No, thank you, sir.”\n\n“And what for, ‘no, thank you?’ if one may inquire.”\n\n“I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:\ntill—”\n\n“Till what?\_ You delight in half-phrases.”\n\n“Till I can’t help it.”\n\n“Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the\ncompanion of my repast?”\n\n“I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on\nas usual for another month.”\n\n“You will give up your governessing slavery at once.”\n\n“Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.\_ I shall just go on with\nit as usual.\_ I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been\naccustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel\ndisposed to see me, and I’ll come then; but at no other time.”\n\n“I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all\nthis, ‘pour me donner une contenance,’ as Adèle would say; and\nunfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.\_ But\nlisten—whisper.\_ It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine\npresently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold,\nI’ll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this”\n(touching his watch-guard).\_ “Yes, bonny wee thing, I’ll wear you in my\nbosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.”\n\nHe said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he\nafterwards lifted out Adèle, I entered the house, and made good my\nretreat upstairs.\n\nHe duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.\_ I had prepared an\noccupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in\na tête-à-tête conversation.\_ I remembered his fine voice; I knew he\nliked to sing—good singers generally do.\_ I was no vocalist myself, and,\nin his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in\nlistening when the performance was good.\_ No sooner had twilight, that\nhour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the\nlattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love\nof heaven, to give me a song.\_ He said I was a capricious witch, and\nthat he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was\nlike the present.\n\n“Did I like his voice?” he asked.\n\n“Very much.”\_ I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of\nhis; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e’en soothe\nand stimulate it.\n\n“Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.”\n\n“Very well, sir, I will try.”\n\nI did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated “a\nlittle bungler.”\_ Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was\nprecisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany\nhimself: for he could play as well as sing.\_ I hied me to the\nwindow-recess.\_ And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees\nand dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following\nstrain:—\n\n“The truest love that ever heart\n \_\_ Felt at its kindled core,\n Did through each vein, in quickened start,\n \_\_ The tide of being pour.\n\nHer coming was my hope each day,\n \_\_ Her parting was my pain;\n The chance that did her steps delay\n \_\_ Was ice in every vein.\n\nI dreamed it would be nameless bliss,\n \_\_ As I loved, loved to be;\n And to this object did I press\n \_\_ As blind as eagerly.\n\nBut wide as pathless was the space\n \_\_ That lay our lives between,\n And dangerous as the foamy race\n \_\_ Of ocean-surges green.\n\nAnd haunted as a robber-path\n \_\_ Through wilderness or wood;\n For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,\n \_\_ Between our spirits stood.\n\nI dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;\n \_\_ I omens did defy:\n Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,\n \_\_ I passed impetuous by.\n\nOn sped my rainbow, fast as light;\n \_\_ I flew as in a dream;\n For glorious rose upon my sight\n \_\_ That child of Shower and Gleam.\n\nStill bright on clouds of suffering dim\n \_\_ Shines that soft, solemn joy;\n Nor care I now, how dense and grim\n \_\_ Disasters gather nigh.\n\nI care not in this moment sweet,\n \_\_ Though all I have rushed o’er\n Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,\n \_\_ Proclaiming vengeance sore:\n\nThough haughty Hate should strike me down,\n \_\_ Right, bar approach to me,\n And grinding Might, with furious frown,\n \_\_ Swear endless enmity.\n\nMy love has placed her little hand\n \_\_ With noble faith in mine,\n And vowed that wedlock’s sacred band\n \_\_ Our nature shall entwine.\n\nMy love has sworn, with sealing kiss,\n \_\_ With me to live—to die;\n I have at last my nameless bliss.\n \_\_ As I love—loved am I!”\n\n\nHe rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his\nfull falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every\nlineament.\_ I quailed momentarily—then I rallied.\_ Soft scene, daring\ndemonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon\nof defence must be prepared—I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I\nasked with asperity, “whom he was going to marry now?”\n\n“That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.”\n\n“Indeed!\_ I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had\ntalked of his future wife dying with him.\_ What did he mean by such a\npagan idea?\_ I had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on\nthat.”\n\n“Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!\_\nDeath was not for such as I.”\n\n“Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he\nhad: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.”\n\n“Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a\nreconciling kiss?”\n\n“No: I would rather be excused.”\n\nHere I heard myself apostrophised as a “hard little thing;” and it was\nadded, “any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such\nstanzas crooned in her praise.”\n\nI assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often\nfind me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers\nrugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he\nshould know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was\nyet time to rescind it.\n\n“Would I be quiet and talk rationally?”\n\n“I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered\nmyself I was doing that now.”\n\nHe fretted, pished, and pshawed.\_ “Very good,” I thought; “you may fume\nand fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you,\nI am certain.\_ I like you more than I can say; but I’ll not sink into a\nbathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I’ll keep you from\nthe edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid\nthat distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual\nadvantage.”\n\nFrom less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,\nafter he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I\ngot up, and saying, “I wish you good-night, sir,” in my natural and\nwonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.\n\nThe system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of\nprobation; and with the best success.\_ He was kept, to be sure, rather\ncross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently\nentertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove\nsensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his\njudgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.\n\nIn other people’s presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet;\nany other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening\nconferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.\_ He continued to send for\nme punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared\nbefore him now, he had no such honeyed terms as “love” and “darling” on\nhis lips: the best words at my service were “provoking puppet,”\n“malicious elf,” “sprite,” “changeling,” &c.\_ For caresses, too, I now\ngot grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss\non the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.\_ It was all right: at present I\ndecidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.\_ Mrs.\nFairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;\ntherefore I was certain I did well.\_ Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I\nwas wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my\npresent conduct at some period fast coming.\_ I laughed in my sleeve at\nhis menaces.\_ “I can keep you in reasonable check now,” I reflected;\n“and I don’t doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses\nits virtue, another must be devised.”\n\nYet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have\npleased than teased him.\_ My future husband was becoming to me my whole\nworld; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.\_ He stood\nbetween me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes\nbetween man and the broad sun.\_ I could not, in those days, see God for\nHis creature: of whom I had made an idol.\n"
