title: "\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nMr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early that\nnight; nor did he rise soon next morning.\_ When he did come down, it was\nto attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,\nand waiting to speak with him.\n\nAdèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily\nrequisition as a reception-room for callers.\_ A fire was lit in an\napartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for\nthe future schoolroom.\_ I discerned in the course of the morning that\nThornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it\nechoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;\nsteps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different\nkeys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a\nmaster: for my part, I liked it better.\n\nAdèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept\nrunning to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could\nget a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go\ndownstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,\nwhere I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and\nmade her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami,\nMonsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not\nbefore heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had\nbrought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when\nhis luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little\nbox in whose contents she had an interest.\n\n“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau\npour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.\_ Monsieur a parlé\nde vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était pas\nune petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle.\_ J’ai dit qu’oui: car\nc’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?”\n\nI and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the afternoon\nwas wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.\_ At dark I\nallowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,\nfrom the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to\nthe door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.\_\nLeft alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:\ntwilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very\nshrubs on the lawn.\_ I let down the curtain and went back to the\nfireside.\n\nIn the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I\nremembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when\nMrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had\nbeen piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts\nthat were beginning to throng on my solitude.\n\n“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with\nhim in the drawing-room this evening,” said she: “he has been so much\nengaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.”\n\n“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.\n\n“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country.\_ You had\nbetter change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.\_ Here is\na candle.”\n\n“Is it necessary to change my frock?”\n\n“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester\nis here.”\n\nThis additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to\nmy room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by\none of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except\none of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I\nthought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.\n\n“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax.\_ I had a single little pearl\nornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,\nand then we went downstairs.\_ Unused as I was to strangers, it was\nrather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s\npresence.\_ I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept\nin her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose\ncurtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.\n\nTwo wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;\nbasking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt\nnear him.\_ Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot\nsupported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire\nshone full on his face.\_ I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty\neyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of\nhis black hair.\_ I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for\ncharacter than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;\nhis grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no\nmistake.\_ His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in\nsquareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the\nathletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though\nneither tall nor graceful.\n\nMr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and\nmyself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he\nnever lifted his head as we approached.\n\n“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.\_ He\nbowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\n\n“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he: and there was something in the\nforced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further\nto express, “What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or\nnot?\_ At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.”\n\nI sat down quite disembarrassed.\_ A reception of finished politeness\nwould probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it\nby answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me\nunder no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the\nfreak of manner, gave me the advantage.\_ Besides, the eccentricity of\nthe proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.\n\nHe went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.\_ Mrs.\nFairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable,\nand she began to talk.\_ Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she\ncondoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the\nannoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she\ncommended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.\n\n“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got.\_ She\nhastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to\narrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.\_ I and Adèle\nwent to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.\n\n“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle\nmight perhaps spill it.”\n\nI did as requested.\_ As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking\nthe moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—\n\n“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans\nvotre petit coffre?”\n\n“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly.\_ “Did you expect a present,\nMiss Eyre?\_ Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with eyes\nthat I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.\n\n“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are\ngenerally thought pleasant things.”\n\n“Generally thought?\_ But what do you think?”\n\n“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an\nanswer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it\nnot? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to\nits nature.”\n\n“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a\n‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.”\n\n“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can\nprefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for\nshe says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but\nif I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,\nand have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”\n\n“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty!\_ I have examined Adèle, and find\nyou have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no\ntalents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.”\n\n“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the\nmeed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”\n\n“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\n\n“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray was taken away, and\nMrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle\nwas leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful\nbooks and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières.\_ We obeyed, as in\nduty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered\nto amuse herself with Pilot.\n\n“You have been resident in my house three months?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And you came from—?”\n\n“From Lowood school, in ---shire.”\n\n“Ah! a charitable concern.\_ How long were you there?”\n\n“Eight years.”\n\n“Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.\_ I thought half the time in\nsuch a place would have done up any constitution!\_ No wonder you have\nrather the look of another world.\_ I marvelled where you had got that\nsort of face.\_ When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought\nunaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you\nhad bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.\_ Who are your parents?”\n\n“I have none.”\n\n“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I thought not.\_ And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on\nthat stile?”\n\n“For whom, sir?”\n\n“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.\_ Did\nI break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on\nthe causeway?”\n\nI shook my head.\_ “The men in green all forsook England a hundred years\nago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.\_ “And not even in\nHay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.\_ I\ndon’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on\ntheir revels more.”\n\nMrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed\nwondering what sort of talk this was.\n\n“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must have\nsome sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”\n\n“No; none that I ever saw.”\n\n“And your home?”\n\n“I have none.”\n\n“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”\n\n“I have no brothers or sisters.”\n\n“Who recommended you to come here?”\n\n“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.”\n\n“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, “and I\nam daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.\_ Miss Eyre\nhas been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher\nto Adèle.”\n\n“Don’t trouble yourself to give her a character,” returned Mr.\nRochester: “eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.\_ She\nbegan by felling my horse.”\n\n“Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.\n\n“I have to thank her for this sprain.”\n\nThe widow looked bewildered.\n\n“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Have you seen much society?”\n\n“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\nThornfield.”\n\n“Have you read much?”\n\n“Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or\nvery learned.”\n\n“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in\nreligious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a\nparson, is he not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses\nwould worship their director.”\n\n“Oh, no.”\n\n“You are very cool!\_ No!\_ What! a novice not worship her priest!\_ That\nsounds blasphemous.”\n\n“I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.\_ He is\na harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for\neconomy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could\nhardly sew.”\n\n“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again\ncaught the drift of the dialogue.\n\n“And was that the head and front of his offending?” demanded Mr.\nRochester.\n\n“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision\ndepartment, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with\nlong lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his\nown inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to\ngo to bed.”\n\n“What age were you when you went to Lowood?”\n\n“About ten.”\n\n“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”\n\nI assented.\n\n“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have\nbeen able to guess your age.\_ It is a point difficult to fix where the\nfeatures and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.\_ And\nnow what did you learn at Lowood?\_ Can you play?”\n\n“A little.”\n\n“Of course: that is the established answer.\_ Go into the library—I mean,\nif you please.—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’\nand it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new\ninmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the\ndoor open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.”\n\nI departed, obeying his directions.\n\n“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes.\_ “You play a little, I\nsee; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than\nsome, but not well.”\n\nI closed the piano and returned.\_ Mr. Rochester continued—“Adèle showed\nme some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.\_ I don’t know\nwhether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?”\n\n“No, indeed!” I interjected.\n\n“Ah! that pricks pride.\_ Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch\nfor its contents being original; but don’t pass your word unless you are\ncertain: I can recognise patchwork.”\n\n“Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.”\n\nI brought the portfolio from the library.\n\n“Approach the table,” said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.\_ Adèle and\nMrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.\n\n“No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the drawings from my hand as I\nfinish with them; but don’t push your faces up to mine.”\n\nHe deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.\_ Three he laid\naside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.\n\n“Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” said he, “and look at\nthem with Adèle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume your seat, and answer my\nquestions.\_ I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that\nhand yours?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And when did you find time to do them?\_ They have taken much time, and\nsome thought.”\n\n“I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no\nother occupation.”\n\n“Where did you get your copies?”\n\n“Out of my head.”\n\n“That head I see now on your shoulders?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Has it other furniture of the same kind within?”\n\n“I should think it may have: I should hope—better.”\n\nHe spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.\n\nWhile he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and\nfirst, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.\_ The subjects\nhad, indeed, risen vividly on my mind.\_ As I saw them with the spiritual\neye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand\nwould not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a\npale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\n\nThese pictures were in water-colours.\_ The first represented clouds low\nand livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;\nso, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there\nwas no land.\_ One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged\nmast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with\nfoam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched\nwith as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering\ndistinctness as my pencil could impart.\_ Sinking below the bird and\nmast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was\nthe only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or\ntorn.\n\nThe second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,\nwith grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.\_ Beyond and above\nspread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky\nwas a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as\nI could combine.\_ The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the\nlineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes\nshone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud\ntorn by storm or by electric travail.\_ On the neck lay a pale reflection\nlike moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds\nfrom which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\n\nThe third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:\na muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried,\nalong the horizon.\_ Throwing these into distance, rose, in the\nforeground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and\nresting against it.\_ Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and\nsupporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow\nquite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of\nmeaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible.\_ Above\nthe temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its\ncharacter and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,\ngemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.\_ This pale crescent was “the\nlikeness of a kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which shape\nhad none.”\n\n“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked Mr. Rochester\npresently.\n\n“I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.\_ To paint them, in short,\nwas to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.”\n\n“That is not saying much.\_ Your pleasures, by your own account, have\nbeen few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland\nwhile you blent and arranged these strange tints.\_ Did you sit at them\nlong each day?”\n\n“I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at\nthem from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the\nmidsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.”\n\n“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?”\n\n“Far from it.\_ I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my\nhandiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite\npowerless to realise.”\n\n“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,\nprobably.\_ You had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to give\nit full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.\_ As to\nthe thoughts, they are elfish.\_ These eyes in the Evening Star you must\nhave seen in a dream.\_ How could you make them look so clear, and yet\nnot at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.\_ And what\nmeaning is that in their solemn depth?\_ And who taught you to paint\nwind?\_ There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.\_ Where\ndid you see Latmos?\_ For that is Latmos.\_ There! put the drawings away!”\n\nI had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his\nwatch, he said abruptly—\n\n“It is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adèle sit up\nso long?\_ Take her to bed.”\n\nAdèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,\nbut scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so\nmuch.\n\n“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making a movement of the hand\ntowards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished\nto dismiss us.\_ Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my\nportfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so\nwithdrew.\n\n“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” I\nobserved, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.\n\n“Well, is he?”\n\n“I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.”\n\n“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed\nto his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of\ntemper, allowance should be made.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature;\nand partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and\nmake his spirits unequal.”\n\n“What about?”\n\n“Family troubles, for one thing.”\n\n“But he has no family.”\n\n“Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives.\_ He lost his elder\nbrother a few years since.”\n\n“His elder brother?”\n\n“Yes.\_ The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of\nthe property; only about nine years.”\n\n“Nine years is a tolerable time.\_ Was he so very fond of his brother as\nto be still inconsolable for his loss?”\n\n“Why, no—perhaps not.\_ I believe there were some misunderstandings\nbetween them.\_ Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;\nand perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.\_ The old gentleman was\nfond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.\_ He did\nnot like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious\nthat Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of\nthe name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were\nnot quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.\_ Old Mr. Rochester\nand Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a\npainful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise\nnature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could\nnot brook what he had to suffer in it.\_ He is not very forgiving: he\nbroke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled\nkind of life.\_ I don’t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for\na fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left\nhim master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old\nplace.”\n\n“Why should he shun it?”\n\n“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.”\n\nThe answer was evasive.\_ I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.\nFairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit\ninformation of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials.\_ She\naverred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was\nchiefly from conjecture.\_ It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to\ndrop the subject, which I did accordingly.\n"
