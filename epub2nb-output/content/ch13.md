title: "\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nA new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and\nwhen I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a\nroom in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on\nthe walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such\nornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of\nGeorge the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a\nrepresentation of the death of Wolfe.\_ All this is visible to you by the\nlight of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an\nexcellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and\numbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill\ncontracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day:\nI left Lowton at four o’clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now\njust striking eight.\n\nReader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil\nin my mind.\_ I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some\none to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps\nthe “boots” placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name\npronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me\nto Thornfield.\_ Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a\nwaiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered\nin the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a\nprivate room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears\nare troubling my thoughts.\n\nIt is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself\nquite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain\nwhether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by\nmany impediments from returning to that it has quitted.\_ The charm of\nadventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then\nthe throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when\nhalf-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.\_ I bethought myself to ring\nthe bell.\n\n“Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?” I asked of\nthe waiter who answered the summons.\n\n“Thornfield?\_ I don’t know, ma’am; I’ll inquire at the bar.”\_ He\nvanished, but reappeared instantly—\n\n“Is your name Eyre, Miss?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Person here waiting for you.”\n\nI jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the\ninn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit\nstreet I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.\n\n“This will be your luggage, I suppose?” said the man rather abruptly\nwhen he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.\n\n“Yes.”\_ He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and\nthen I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to\nThornfield.\n\n“A matter of six miles.”\n\n“How long shall we be before we get there?”\n\n“Happen an hour and a half.”\n\nHe fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set\noff.\_ Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I\nwas content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I\nleaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I\nmeditated much at my ease.\n\n“I suppose,” thought I, “judging from the plainness of the servant and\ncarriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;\nI never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable\nwith them.\_ I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so,\nand if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on\nwith her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one’s best does not\nalways answer.\_ At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and\nsucceeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always\nspurned with scorn.\_ I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second\nMrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the\nworst come to the worst, I can advertise again.\_ How far are we on our\nroad now, I wonder?”\n\nI let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by\nthe number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,\nmuch larger than Lowton.\_ We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort\nof common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt\nwe were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less\npicturesque; more stirring, less romantic.\n\nThe roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk\nall the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two\nhours; at last he turned in his seat and said—\n\n“You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.”\n\nAgain I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower\nagainst the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow\ngalaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.\_ About\nten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we\npassed through, and they clashed to behind us.\_ We now slowly ascended a\ndrive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from\none curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.\_ The car stopped at\nthe front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.\n\n“Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the girl; and I followed her\nacross a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a\nroom whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me,\ncontrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for\ntwo hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable\npicture presented itself to my view.\n\nA snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair\nhigh-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little\nelderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;\nexactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and\nmilder looking.\_ She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely\nat her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of\ndomestic comfort.\_ A more reassuring introduction for a new governess\ncould scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no\nstateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up\nand promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\n\n“How do you do, my dear?\_ I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John\ndrives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.”\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?” said I.\n\n“Yes, you are right: do sit down.”\n\nShe conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and\nuntie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much\ntrouble.\n\n“Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with\ncold.\_ Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are\nthe keys of the storeroom.”\n\nAnd she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and\ndelivered them to the servant.\n\n“Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she continued.\_ “You’ve brought\nyour luggage with you, haven’t you, my dear?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n\n“I’ll see it carried into your room,” she said, and bustled out.\n\n“She treats me like a visitor,” thought I.\_ “I little expected such a\nreception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like\nwhat I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult\ntoo soon.”\n\nShe returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a\nbook or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now\nbrought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.\_ I felt rather\nconfused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before\nreceived, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she\ndid not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her\nplace, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.\n\n“Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?” I asked,\nwhen I had partaken of what she offered me.\n\n“What did you say, my dear?\_ I am a little deaf,” returned the good\nlady, approaching her ear to my mouth.\n\nI repeated the question more distinctly.\n\n“Miss Fairfax?\_ Oh, you mean Miss Varens!\_ Varens is the name of your\nfuture pupil.”\n\n“Indeed!\_ Then she is not your daughter?”\n\n“No,—I have no family.”\n\nI should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss\nVarens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to\nask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\n\n“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took\nthe cat on her knee; “I am so glad you are come; it will be quite\npleasant living here now with a companion.\_ To be sure it is pleasant at\nany time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late\nyears perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in\nwinter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.\_ I say\nalone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very\ndecent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can’t\nconverse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due\ndistance, for fear of losing one’s authority.\_ I’m sure last winter (it\nwas a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it\nrained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the\nhouse, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy\nwith sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me\nsometimes; but I don’t think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt\nit confining.\_ In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long\ndays make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this\nautumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house\nalive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.”\n\nMy heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I\ndrew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that\nshe might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.\n\n“But I’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said she; “it is on\nthe stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must\nfeel tired.\_ If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll show you your\nbedroom.\_ I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a\nsmall apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the\nlarge front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are\nso dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.”\n\nI thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued\nwith my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.\_ She took her\ncandle, and I followed her from the room.\_ First she went to see if the\nhall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the\nway upstairs.\_ The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window\nwas high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the\nbedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than\na house.\_ A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and\ngallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was\nglad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small\ndimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\n\nWhen Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my\ndoor, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie\nimpression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and\nthat long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I\nremembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was\nnow at last in safe haven.\_ The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,\nand I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were\ndue; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and\nthe power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me\nbefore it was earned.\_ My couch had no thorns in it that night; my\nsolitary room no fears.\_ At once weary and content, I slept soon and\nsoundly: when I awoke it was broad day.\n\nThe chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in\nbetween the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a\ncarpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,\nthat my spirits rose at the view.\_ Externals have a great effect on the\nyoung: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one\nthat was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and\ntoils.\_ My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field\noffered to hope, seemed all astir.\_ I cannot precisely define what they\nexpected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that\nmonth, but at an indefinite future period.\n\nI rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no\narticle of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still\nby nature solicitous to be neat.\_ It was not my habit to be disregardful\nof appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I\never wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want\nof beauty would permit.\_ I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;\nI sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small\ncherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in\nfigure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had\nfeatures so irregular and so marked.\_ And why had I these aspirations\nand these regrets?\_ It would be difficult to say: I could not then\ndistinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural\nreason too.\_ However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on\nmy black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of\nfitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I\nshould do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my\nnew pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.\_ Having\nopened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and\nneat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\n\nTraversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps\nof oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at\nsome pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a\ncuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a\nbronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of\noak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.\_ Everything\nappeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little\naccustomed to grandeur.\_ The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood\nopen; I stepped over the threshold.\_ It was a fine autumn morning; the\nearly sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;\nadvancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the\nmansion.\_ It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though\nconsiderable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat:\nbattlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.\_ Its grey front\nstood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants\nwere now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a\ngreat meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where\nan array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks,\nat once explained the etymology of the mansion’s designation.\_ Farther\noff were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor\nso like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and\nlonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion\nI had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of\nMillcote.\_ A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled\nup the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood\nnearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the\nhouse and gates.\n\nI was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet\nlistening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the\nwide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was\nfor one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady\nappeared at the door.\n\n“What! out already?” said she.\_ “I see you are an early riser.”\_ I went\nup to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.\n\n“How do you like Thornfield?” she asked.\_ I told her I liked it very\nmuch.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting\nout of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come\nand reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener:\ngreat houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed.\_ “Who is he?”\n\n“The owner of Thornfield,” she responded quietly.\_ “Did you not know he\nwas called Rochester?”\n\nOf course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but the old lady\nseemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with\nwhich everybody must be acquainted by instinct.\n\n“I thought,” I continued, “Thornfield belonged to you.”\n\n“To me?\_ Bless you, child; what an idea!\_ To me!\_ I am only the\nhousekeeper—the manager.\_ To be sure I am distantly related to the\nRochesters by the mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a\nclergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and\nthat church near the gates was his.\_ The present Mr. Rochester’s mother\nwas a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on\nthe connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in\nthe light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I\nexpect nothing more.”\n\n“And the little girl—my pupil!”\n\n“She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for\nher.\_ He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.\_ Here\nshe comes, with her ‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.”\_ The enigma then\nwas explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but\na dependant like myself.\_ I did not like her the worse for that; on the\ncontrary, I felt better pleased than ever.\_ The equality between her and\nme was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much\nthe better—my position was all the freer.\n\nAs I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her\nattendant, came running up the lawn.\_ I looked at my pupil, who did not\nat first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or\neight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a\nredundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.\n\n“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs. Fairfax.\_ “Come and speak to the\nlady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.”\_ She\napproached.\n\n“C’est là ma gouverante!” said she, pointing to me, and addressing her\nnurse; who answered—\n\n“Mais oui, certainement.”\n\n“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at hearing the French\nlanguage.\n\n“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I\nbelieve, never left it till within six months ago.\_ When she first came\nhere she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a\nlittle: I don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you\nwill make out her meaning very well, I dare say.”\n\nFortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French\nlady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot\nas often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years,\nlearnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to take pains\nwith my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation\nof my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and\ncorrectness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss\nwith Mademoiselle Adela.\_ She came and shook hand with me when she heard\nthat I was her governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed\nsome phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but\nafter we were seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten\nminutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering\nfluently.\n\n“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my language as well as Mr.\nRochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.\_\nShe will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all\nEnglish.\_ Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great\nship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and so\nwas Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.\_ Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa\nin a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in\nanother place.\_ I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.\_ And\nMademoiselle—what is your name?”\n\n“Eyre—Jane Eyre.”\n\n“Aire?\_ Bah!\_ I cannot say it.\_ Well, our ship stopped in the morning,\nbefore it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very\ndark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came\nfrom; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,\nand Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a\nbeautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.\_ We\nstayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a\ngreat green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many\nchildren there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I\nfed with crumbs.”\n\n“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nI understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent\ntongue of Madame Pierrot.\n\n“I wish,” continued the good lady, “you would ask her a question or two\nabout her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?”\n\n“Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did you live when you were in that\npretty clean town you spoke of?”\n\n“I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.\_ Mama\nused to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.\_ A great many\ngentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,\nor to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.\_ Shall I let you\nhear me sing now?”\n\nShe had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of\nher accomplishments.\_ Descending from her chair, she came and placed\nherself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,\nshaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she\ncommenced singing a song from some opera.\_ It was the strain of a\nforsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls\npride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest\njewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night\nat a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little\nhis desertion has affected her.\n\nThe subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose\nthe point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and\njealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that\npoint was: at least I thought so.\n\nAdèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naïveté of\nher age.\_ This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, “Now,\nMademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.”\n\nAssuming an attitude, she began, “La Ligue des Rats: fable de La\nFontaine.”\_ She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to\npunctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness\nof gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had\nbeen carefully trained.\n\n“Was it your mama who taught you that piece?” I asked.\n\n“Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: ‘Qu’ avez vous donc? lui\ndit un de ces rats; parlez!’\_ She made me lift my hand—so—to remind me\nto raise my voice at the question.\_ Now shall I dance for you?”\n\n“No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you\nsay, with whom did you live then?”\n\n“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is\nnothing related to me.\_ I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a\nhouse as mama.\_ I was not long there.\_ Mr. Rochester asked me if I would\nlike to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.\nRochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me\nand gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his\nword, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again\nhimself, and I never see him.”\n\nAfter breakfast, Adèle and I withdrew to the library, which room, it\nappears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.\_\nMost of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one\nbookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way\nof elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,\nbiography, travels, a few romances, &c.\_ I suppose he had considered\nthat these were all the governess would require for her private perusal;\nand, indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the\nscanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they\nseemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.\_\nIn this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior\ntone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.\n\nI found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she\nhad not been used to regular occupation of any kind.\_ I felt it would be\ninjudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to\nher a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning\nhad advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.\_ I then\nproposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little\nsketches for her use.\n\nAs I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax\ncalled to me: “Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,” said\nshe.\_ She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in\nwhen she addressed me.\_ It was a large, stately apartment, with purple\nchairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast\nwindow rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.\_ Mrs.\nFairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a\nsideboard.\n\n“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never\nbefore seen any half so imposing.\n\n“Yes; this is the dining-room.\_ I have just opened the window, to let in\na little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments\nthat are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”\n\nShe pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it\nwith a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.\_ Mounting to it by two broad\nsteps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy\nplace, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.\_ Yet it was\nmerely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread\nwith white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;\nboth ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves,\nbeneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans;\nwhile the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling\nBohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated\nthe general blending of snow and fire.\n\n“In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!” said I.\_ “No dust,\nno canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think\nthey were inhabited daily.”\n\n“Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they are\nalways sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to\nfind everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his\narrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.”\n\n“Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?”\n\n“Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s tastes and habits, and he\nexpects to have things managed in conformity to them.”\n\n“Do you like him?\_ Is he generally liked?”\n\n“Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.\_ Almost all the\nland in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the\nRochesters time out of mind.”\n\n“Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?\_ Is\nhe liked for himself?”\n\n“I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is\nconsidered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never\nlived much amongst them.”\n\n“But has he no peculiarities?\_ What, in short, is his character?”\n\n“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.\_ He is rather peculiar,\nperhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the\nworld, I should think.\_ I dare say he is clever, but I never had much\nconversation with him.”\n\n“In what way is he peculiar?”\n\n“I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel\nit when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in\njest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t\nthoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I don’t: but it is of no\nconsequence, he is a very good master.”\n\nThis was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and\nmine.\_ There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a\ncharacter, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons\nor things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries\npuzzled, but did not draw her out.\_ Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in\nher eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: she inquired\nand searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a\nmore definite notion of his identity.\n\nWhen we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of\nthe house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I\nwent; for all was well arranged and handsome.\_ The large front chambers\nI thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though\ndark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.\_ The\nfurniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to\ntime been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light\nentering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years\nold; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of\npalm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of\nvenerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated,\non whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced\nembroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been\ncoffin-dust.\_ All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield\nHall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory.\_ I liked the\nhush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by\nno means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:\nshut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought\nold English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of\nstrange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,—all\nwhich would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of\nmoonlight.\n\n“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked.\n\n“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever\nsleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at\nThornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.”\n\n“So I think: you have no ghost, then?”\n\n“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\n\n“Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?”\n\n“I believe not.\_ And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a\nviolent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the\nreason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.”\n\n“Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’” I muttered.\_ “Where\nare you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away.\n\n“On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?”\_ I\nfollowed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by\na ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.\_ I was now on\na level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.\_ Leaning\nover the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid\nout like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey\nbase of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient\ntimber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown,\ngreener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the\ngates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s\nsun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly\nwhite.\_ No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was\npleasing.\_ When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could\nscarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault\ncompared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and\nto that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the\nhall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.\n\nMrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift\nof groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend\nthe narrow garret staircase.\_ I lingered in the long passage to which\nthis led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey:\nnarrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and\nlooking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a\ncorridor in some Bluebeard’s castle.\n\nWhile I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a\nregion, a laugh, struck my ear.\_ It was a curious laugh; distinct,\nformal, mirthless.\_ I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it\nbegan again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.\_ It\npassed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every\nlonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have\npointed out the door whence the accents issued.\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out: for I now heard her descending the great\nstairs.\_ “Did you hear that loud laugh?\_ Who is it?”\n\n“Some of the servants, very likely,” she answered: “perhaps Grace\nPoole.”\n\n“Did you hear it?” I again inquired.\n\n“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.\_\nSometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.”\n\nThe laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an\nodd murmur.\n\n“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\n\nI really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as\ntragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it\nwas high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the\ncurious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I\nshould have been superstitiously afraid.\_ However, the event showed me I\nwas a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.\n\nThe door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between\nthirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a\nhard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could\nscarcely be conceived.\n\n“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax.\_ “Remember directions!”\_\nGrace curtseyed silently and went in.\n\n“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s\nwork,” continued the widow; “not altogether unobjectionable in some\npoints, but she does well enough.\_ By-the-bye, how have you got on with\nyour new pupil this morning?”\n\nThe conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till we reached the\nlight and cheerful region below.\_ Adèle came running to meet us in the\nhall, exclaiming—\n\n“Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!”\n\nWe found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.\n"
