title: "\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nI both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed\nthis sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to\nmeet his eye.\_ During the early part of the morning, I momentarily\nexpected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the\nschoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had\nthe impression that he was sure to visit it that day.\n\nBut the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the\nquiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some\nbustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax’s\nvoice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and even John’s\nown gruff tones.\_ There were exclamations of “What a mercy master was\nnot burnt in his bed!”\_ “It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at\nnight.”\_ “How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the\nwater-jug!”\_ “I wonder he waked nobody!”\_ “It is to be hoped he will not\ntake cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &c.\n\nTo much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to\nrights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw\nthrough the open door that all was again restored to complete order;\nonly the bed was stripped of its hangings.\_ Leah stood up in the\nwindow-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.\_ I was about\nto address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the\naffair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman\nsitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.\_\nThat woman was no other than Grace Poole.\n\nThere she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff\ngown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.\_ She was intent on\nher work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard\nforehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the\npaleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the\ncountenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended\nvictim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),\ncharged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.\_ I was\namazed—confounded.\_ She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,\nno increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of\nguilt, or fear of detection.\_ She said “Good morning, Miss,” in her\nusual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more\ntape, went on with her sewing.\n\n“I will put her to some test,” thought I: “such absolute impenetrability\nis past comprehension.”\n\n“Good morning, Grace,” I said.\_ “Has anything happened here?\_ I thought\nI heard the servants all talking together a while ago.”\n\n“Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with\nhis candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke\nbefore the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench\nthe flames with the water in the ewer.”\n\n“A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her\nfixedly—“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?\_ Did no one hear him move?”\n\nShe again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of\nconsciousness in their expression.\_ She seemed to examine me warily;\nthen she answered—\n\n“The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely\nto hear.\_ Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to master’s; but\nMrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often\nsleep heavy.”\_ She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed\nindifference, but still in a marked and significant tone—“But you are\nyoung, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have\nheard a noise?”\n\n“I did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still\npolishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was\nPilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a\nstrange one.”\n\nShe took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her\nneedle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—\n\n“It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he\nwas in such danger: You must have been dreaming.”\n\n“I was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness\nprovoked me.\_ Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and\nconscious eye.\n\n“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired.\n\n“I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.”\n\n“You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the\ngallery?” she further asked.\n\nShe appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me\ninformation unawares.\_ The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew\nor suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant\npranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.\n\n“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.”\n\n“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before\nyou get into bed?”\n\n“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans\naccordingly!”\_ Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied\nsharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not\nthink it necessary.\_ I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be\ndreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on\nthe words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture\nto lie down.”\n\n“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as\nquiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by\nrobbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’ worth\nof plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.\_ And you see, for such a\nlarge house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived\nhere much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little\nwaiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door\nis soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and\nany mischief that may be about.\_ A deal of people, Miss, are for\ntrusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with\nthe means, though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.”\_\nAnd here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with\nthe demureness of a Quakeress.\n\nI still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her\nmiraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook\nentered.\n\n“Mrs. Poole,” said she, addressing Grace, “the servants’ dinner will\nsoon be ready: will you come down?”\n\n“No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I’ll\ncarry it upstairs.”\n\n“You’ll have some meat?”\n\n“Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.”\n\n“And the sago?”\n\n“Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I’ll\nmake it myself.”\n\nThe cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:\nso I departed.\n\nI hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration\nduring dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the\nenigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the\nproblem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not\nbeen given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed\nfrom her master’s service.\_ He had almost as much as declared his\nconviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld\nhim from accusing her?\_ Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?\_ It was\nstrange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the\npower of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power,\nthat even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly\ncharge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.\n\nHad Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think\nthat tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in\nher behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could\nnot be admitted.\_ “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once; her\nyouth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me\nonce, she had lived here many years.\_ I don’t think she can ever have\nbeen pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and\nstrength of character to compensate for the want of personal\nadvantages.\_ Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:\nGrace is eccentric at least.\_ What if a former caprice (a freak very\npossible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him\ninto her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret\ninfluence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake\noff, and dare not disregard?”\_ But, having reached this point of\nconjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even\ncoarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought,\n“No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct.\_ Yet,” suggested the\nsecret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “you are not beautiful\neither, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have\noften felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words; remember his\nlook; remember his voice!”\n\nI well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment\nvividly renewed.\_ I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent\nover her and directed her pencil.\_ She looked up with a sort of start.\n\n“Qu’ avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she.\_ “Vos doigts tremblent comme la\nfeuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”\n\n“I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!”\_ She went on sketching; I went on\nthinking.\n\nI hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been\nconceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.\_ I compared myself\nwith her, and found we were different.\_ Bessie Leaven had said I was\nquite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady.\_ And now I looked much\nbetter than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,\nmore life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener\nenjoyments.\n\n“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window.\_ “I have\nnever heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but\nsurely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the\nmorning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled\nthat it is grown impatient.”\n\nWhen dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the\nnursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.\_ I listened for the\nbell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I\nfancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to the\ndoor, expecting it to open and admit him.\_ The door remained shut;\ndarkness only came in through the window.\_ Still it was not late; he\noften sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six.\_\nSurely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many\nthings to say to him!\_ I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace\nPoole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if\nhe really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous attempt;\nand if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.\_ It little mattered\nwhether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and\nsoothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure\ninstinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of\nprovocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try\nmy skill.\_ Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my\nstation, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy\nrestraint; this suited both him and me.\n\nA tread creaked on the stairs at last.\_ Leah made her appearance; but it\nwas only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.\_ Thither\nI repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I\nimagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.\n\n“You must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you ate\nso little at dinner.\_ I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well\nto-day: you look flushed and feverish.”\n\n“Oh, quite well!\_ I never felt better.”\n\n“Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the\nteapot while I knit off this needle?”\_ Having completed her task, she\nrose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I\nsuppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast\ndeepening into total obscurity.\n\n“It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes,\n“though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable\nday for his journey.”\n\n“Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?\_ I did not know he was out.”\n\n“Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!\_ He is gone to the Leas,\nMr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.\_ I believe\nthere is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,\nColonel Dent, and others.”\n\n“Do you expect him back to-night?”\n\n“No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a\nweek or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are\nso surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can\nplease and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.\_ Gentlemen\nespecially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is\nso talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general\nfavourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think\nhis appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:\nbut I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and\ngood blood, make amends for any little fault of look.”\n\n“Are there ladies at the Leas?”\n\n“There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies\nindeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most\nbeautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven\nyears since, when she was a girl of eighteen.\_ She came here to a\nChristmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.\_ You should have seen the\ndining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit\nup!\_ I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of\nthe first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of\nthe evening.”\n\n“You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?”\n\n“Yes, I saw her.\_ The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was\nChristmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to\nhear some of the ladies sing and play.\_ Mr. Rochester would have me to\ncome in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.\_ I never saw\na more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of\nthem—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram\nwas certainly the queen.”\n\n“And what was she like?”\n\n“Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive\ncomplexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.\nRochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.\_ And then\nshe had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly\narranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the\nglossiest curls I ever saw.\_ She was dressed in pure white; an\namber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast,\ntied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.\_\nShe wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well\nwith the jetty mass of her curls.”\n\n“She was greatly admired, of course?”\n\n“Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.\_\nShe was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the\npiano.\_ She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester?\_ I was not aware he could sing.”\n\n“Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”\n\n“And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?”\n\n“A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to\nlisten to her;—and she played afterwards.\_ I am no judge of music, but\nMr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably\ngood.”\n\n“And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?”\n\n“It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large\nfortunes.\_ Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly entailed, and the\neldest son came in for everything almost.”\n\n“But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:\nMr. Rochester, for instance.\_ He is rich, is he not?”\n\n“Oh! yes.\_ But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.\nRochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”\n\n“What of that?\_ More unequal matches are made every day.”\n\n“True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea\nof the sort.\_ But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you\nbegan tea.”\n\n“No: I am too thirsty to eat.\_ Will you let me have another cup?”\n\nI was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.\nRochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the\nconversation was turned into another channel.\n\nWhen once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into\nmy heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring\nback with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s\nboundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.\n\nArraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,\nwishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the general\nstate of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past;\nReason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain,\nunvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly\ndevoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—\n\nThat a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of\nlife; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet\nlies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.\n\n“You,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester?\_ You gifted with\nthe power of pleasing him?\_ You of importance to him in any way?\_ Go!\nyour folly sickens me.\_ And you have derived pleasure from occasional\ntokens of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and\na man of the world to a dependent and a novice.\_ How dared you?\_ Poor\nstupid dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated\nto yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face\nand be ashamed!\_ He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?\_\nBlind puppy!\_ Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed\nsenselessness!\_ It does good to no woman to be flattered by her\nsuperior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in\nall women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned\nand unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and\nresponded to, must lead, ignis-fatus-like, into miry wilds whence\nthere is no extrication.\n\n“Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass\nbefore you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without\nsoftening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing\nirregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,\npoor, and plain.’\n\n“Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your\ndrawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest\ntints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully\nthe loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and\nsweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of\nBlanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;—What! you\nrevert to Mr. Rochester as a model!\_ Order!\_ No snivel!—no sentiment!—no\nregret!\_ I will endure only sense and resolution.\_ Recall the august yet\nharmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and\ndazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond\nring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aërial lace and\nglistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it ‘Blanche, an\naccomplished lady of rank.’\n\n“Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks\nwell of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, ‘Mr.\nRochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to\nstrive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this\nindigent and insignificant plebeian?’”\n\n“I’ll do it,” I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew\ncalm, and fell asleep.\n\nI kept my word.\_ An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in\ncrayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature\nof an imaginary Blanche Ingram.\_ It looked a lovely face enough, and\nwhen compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as\nself-control could desire.\_ I derived benefit from the task: it had kept\nmy head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new\nimpressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.\n\nEre long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome\ndiscipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.\_ Thanks to\nit, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,\nhad they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to\nmaintain, even externally.\n"
