title: "\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nIt was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general\nholiday approached.\_ I now closed Morton school, taking care that the\nparting should not be barren on my side.\_ Good fortune opens the hand as\nwell as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely\nreceived, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the\nsensations.\_ I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic\nscholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:\nthey manifested their affection plainly and strongly.\_ Deep was my\ngratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated\nhearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I\ndid not visit them, and give them an hour’s teaching in their school.\n\nMr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty\ngirls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in\nmy hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen\nof my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed\nyoung women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.\_\nAnd that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry\nare the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in\nEurope: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bäuerinnen; and the\nbest of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with\nmy Morton girls.\n\n“Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?”\nasked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.\_ “Does not the consciousness of\nhaving done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?”\n\n“Doubtless.”\n\n“And you have only toiled a few months!\_ Would not a life devoted to the\ntask of regenerating your race be well spent?”\n\n“Yes,” I said; “but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my\nown faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.\_ I must\nenjoy them now; don’t recall either my mind or body to the school; I am\nout of it and disposed for full holiday.”\n\nHe looked grave.\_ “What now?\_ What sudden eagerness is this you evince?\_\nWhat are you going to do?”\n\n“To be active: as active as I can.\_ And first I must beg you to set\nHannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.”\n\n“Do you want her?”\n\n“Yes, to go with me to Moor House.\_ Diana and Mary will be at home in a\nweek, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival.”\n\n“I understand.\_ I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.\_ It\nis better so: Hannah shall go with you.”\n\n“Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:\nI will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.”\n\nHe took it.\_ “You give it up very gleefully,” said he; “I don’t quite\nunderstand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment\nyou propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are\nrelinquishing.\_ What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you\nnow?”\n\n“My first aim will be to clean down (do you comprehend the full force\nof the expression?)—to clean down Moor House from chamber to cellar;\nmy next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of\ncloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,\nbed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to\nruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and\nlastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected\nwill be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of\ncurrants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up\nof materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as\nwords can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like\nyou.\_ My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely\nperfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and\nmy ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.”\n\nSt. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.\n\n“It is all very well for the present,” said he; “but seriously, I trust\nthat when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little\nhigher than domestic endearments and household joys.”\n\n“The best things the world has!” I interrupted.\n\n“No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt\nto make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.”\n\n“I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.”\n\n“Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months’ grace I allow you for\nthe full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with\nthis late-found charm of relationship; but then, I hope you will\nbegin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and\nthe selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.\_ I hope\nyour energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.”\n\nI looked at him with surprise.\_ “St. John,” I said, “I think you are\nalmost wicked to talk so.\_ I am disposed to be as content as a queen,\nand you try to stir me up to restlessness!\_ To what end?”\n\n“To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to\nyour keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict\naccount.\_ Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of\nthat.\_ And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you\nthrow yourself into commonplace home pleasures.\_ Don’t cling so\ntenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an\nadequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.\_ Do\nyou hear, Jane?”\n\n“Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.\_ I feel I have adequate cause\nto be happy, and I will be happy.\_ Goodbye!”\n\nHappy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was\ncharmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned\ntopsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.\_ And\nreally, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was\ndelightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had\nmade.\_ I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new\nfurniture: my cousins having given me carte blanche to effect what\nalterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that\npurpose.\_ The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they\nwere: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing\nagain the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the\nspectacle of the smartest innovations.\_ Still some novelty was\nnecessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it\nto be invested.\_ Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement\nof some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,\nnew coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables,\nanswered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring.\_ A spare\nparlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and\ncrimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the\nstairs.\_ When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model\nof bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen\nof wintry waste and desert dreariness without.\n\nThe eventful Thursday at length came.\_ They were expected about dark,\nand ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in\nperfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.\n\nSt. John arrived first.\_ I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the\nhouse till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the\ncommotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls\nsufficed to scare him to estrangement.\_ He found me in the kitchen,\nwatching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.\_\nApproaching the hearth, he asked, “If I was at last satisfied with\nhousemaid’s work?”\_ I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a\ngeneral inspection of the result of my labours.\_ With some difficulty, I\ngot him to make the tour of the house.\_ He just looked in at the doors I\nopened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I must\nhave gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected\nsuch considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he\nutter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his abode.\n\nThis silence damped me.\_ I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed\nsome old associations he valued.\_ I inquired whether this was the case:\nno doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.\n\n“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously\nrespected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed\nmore thought on the matter than it was worth.\_ How many minutes, for\ninstance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very\nroom?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?”\n\nI showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing\nto his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.\n\nNow, I did not like this, reader.\_ St. John was a good man; but I began\nto feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and\ncold.\_ The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for\nhim—its peaceful enjoyments no charm.\_ Literally, he lived only to\naspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would\nnever rest, nor approve of others resting round him.\_ As I looked at his\nlofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments\nfixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a\ngood husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife.\_ I\nunderstood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I\nagreed with him that it was but a love of the senses.\_ I comprehended\nhow he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised\nover him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should\nmistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.\_ I\nsaw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian\nand Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast\nbulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too\noften a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.\n\n“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or\nCaffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him\nbetter.\_ Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his\nelement: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to\nadvantage.\_ It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is\nproved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak\nand move, the leader and superior.\_ A merry child would have the\nadvantage of him on this hearth.\_ He is right to choose a missionary’s\ncareer—I see it now.”\n\n“They are coming! they are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open the\nparlour door.\_ At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.\_ Out I\nran.\_ It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.\_ Hannah\nsoon had a lantern lit.\_ The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the\ndriver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped\nout.\_ In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first\nwith Mary’s soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls.\_ They\nlaughed—kissed me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with\ndelight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the\naffirmative, hastened into the house.\n\nThey were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and\nchilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances\nexpanded to the cheerful firelight.\_ While the driver and Hannah brought\nin the boxes, they demanded St. John.\_ At this moment he advanced from\nthe parlour.\_ They both threw their arms round his neck at once.\_ He\ngave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome,\nstood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed\nthey would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place\nof refuge.\n\nI had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give\nhospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.\_\nThey were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;\nwith the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:\nthey expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.\_ I had the pleasure of\nfeeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I\nhad done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.\n\nSweet was that evening.\_ My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so\neloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John’s\ntaciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow\nof fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.\_ The event of the\nday—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but the\naccompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of\nreception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.\_ In the\nvery meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap\nwas heard at the door.\_ Hannah entered with the intimation that “a poor\nlad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his\nmother, who was drawing away.”\n\n“Where does she live, Hannah?”\n\n“Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss\nall the way.”\n\n“Tell him I will go.”\n\n“I’m sure, sir, you had better not.\_ It’s the worst road to travel after\ndark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog.\_ And then it is\nsuch a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt.\_ You had better send\nword, sir, that you will be there in the morning.”\n\nBut he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one\nobjection, one murmur, he departed.\_ It was then nine o’clock: he did\nnot return till midnight.\_ Starved and tired enough he was: but he\nlooked happier than when he set out.\_ He had performed an act of duty;\nmade an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on\nbetter terms with himself.\n\nI am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.\_ It was\nChristmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort\nof merry domestic dissipation.\_ The air of the moors, the freedom of\nhome, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like\nsome life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from\nnoon till night.\_ They could always talk; and their discourse, witty,\npithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to,\nand sharing in it, to doing anything else.\_ St. John did not rebuke our\nvivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish\nwas large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in\nvisiting the sick and poor in its different districts.\n\nOne morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some\nminutes, asked him, “If his plans were yet unchanged.”\n\n“Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply.\_ And he proceeded to inform\nus that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the\nensuing year.\n\n“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her\nlips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a\ngesture as if wishing to recall them.\_ St. John had a book in his\nhand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and\nlooked up.\n\n“Rosamond Oliver,” said he, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one\nof the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and\nheir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father\nyesterday.”\n\nHis sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:\nhe was serene as glass.\n\n“The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana: “they cannot have\nknown each other long.”\n\n“But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.\_ But\nwhere there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where\nthe connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they\nwill be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to\nthem, can he refitted for their reception.”\n\nThe first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt\ntempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little\nto need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I\nexperienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already\nhazarded.\_ Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve\nwas again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.\_ He\nhad not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually\nmade little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend\nto the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged\nhis kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the\ndistance between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as\nthe village schoolmistress.\_ When I remembered how far I had once been\nadmitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present\nfrigidity.\n\nSuch being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his\nhead suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said—\n\n“You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.”\n\nStartled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a\nmoment’s hesitation I answered—\n\n“But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose\ntriumphs have cost them too dear?\_ Would not such another ruin you?”\n\n“I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be\ncalled upon to contend for such another.\_ The event of the conflict is\ndecisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!”\_ So saying, he\nreturned to his papers and his silence.\n\nAs our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled\ninto a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular\nstudies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room,\nsometimes for hours together.\_ While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course\nof encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken,\nand I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that\nof some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to\nhis plans.\n\nThus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed\nenough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the\noutlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing\nupon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:\nif caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it\nreturned searchingly to our table.\_ I wondered what it meant: I\nwondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit\non an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly\nvisit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day\nwas unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his\nsisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their\nsolicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to\nthe elements.\n\n“Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,” he would say: “she\ncan bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well\nas any of us.\_ Her constitution is both sound and elastic;—better\ncalculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.”\n\nAnd when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little\nweather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur\nwould be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse\nwas a special annoyance.\n\nOne afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really\nhad a cold.\_ His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading\nSchiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.\_ As I exchanged\na translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found\nmyself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.\_ How long it\nhad been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot\ntell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment\nsuperstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.\n\n“Jane, what are you doing?”\n\n“Learning German.”\n\n“I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.”\n\n“You are not in earnest?”\n\n“In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.”\n\nHe then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was\nhimself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget\nthe commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with\nwhom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them\nthoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time\nbetween me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I\ncould sit at a task the longest of the three.\_ Would I do him this\nfavour?\_ I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it\nwanted now barely three months to his departure.\n\nSt. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every\nimpression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and\npermanent.\_ I consented.\_ When Diana and Mary returned, the former found\nher scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both\nshe and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to\nsuch a step.\_ He answered quietly—\n\n“I know it.”\n\nI found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:\nhe expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his\nexpectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.\_ By\ndegrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my\nliberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his\nindifference.\_ I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,\nbecause a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at\nleast in me) was distasteful to him.\_ I was so fully aware that only\nserious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence\nevery effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a\nfreezing spell.\_ When he said “go,” I went; “come,” I came; “do this,” I\ndid it.\_ But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had\ncontinued to neglect me.\n\nOne evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding\nhim good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was\nequally his custom, he gave me his hand.\_ Diana, who chanced to be in a\nfrolicsome humour (she was not painfully controlled by his will; for\nhers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—\n\n“St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don’t treat\nher as such: you should kiss her too.”\n\nShe pushed me towards him.\_ I thought Diana very provoking, and felt\nuncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.\nJohn bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his\neyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me.\_ There are no such\nthings as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical\ncousin’s salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be\nexperiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.\_ When given, he\nviewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not\nblush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this\nkiss were a seal affixed to my fetters.\_ He never omitted the ceremony\nafterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,\nseemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.\n\nAs for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily\nmore and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my\nfaculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the\nadoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.\_ He wanted to\ntrain me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to\naspire to the standard he uplifted.\_ The thing was as impossible as to\nmould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give\nto my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his\nown.\n\nNot his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.\_ Of\nlate it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at\nmy heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of suspense.\n\nPerhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these\nchanges of place and fortune.\_ Not for a moment.\_ His idea was still\nwith me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a\nsand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a\ntablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.\_ The craving\nto know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at\nMorton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now\nat Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.\n\nIn the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the\nwill, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester’s present\nresidence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was\nquite ignorant of all concerning him.\_ I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,\nentreating information on the subject.\_ I had calculated with certainty\non this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early\nanswer.\_ I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but\nwhen two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and\nbrought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.\n\nI wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.\_\nRenewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some\nweeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word\nreached me.\_ When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died\nout, and then I felt dark indeed.\n\nA fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.\_ Summer\napproached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished\nto accompany me to the sea-side.\_ This St. John opposed; he said I did\nnot want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too\npurposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying\ndeficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and\ngrew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,\nnever thought of resisting him—I could not resist him.\n\nOne day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb\nwas occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.\_ Hannah had told me\nin the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take\nit, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me\nat last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.\_\nThe bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring\nover the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe,\nmy eyes filled again.\n\nSt. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my\nvoice failed me: words were lost in sobs.\_ He and I were the only\noccupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the\ndrawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear,\nsunny, and breezy.\_ My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,\nnor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—\n\n“We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.”\_ And\nwhile I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,\nleaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye\nof science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient’s\nmalady.\_ Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something\nabout not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded\nin completing it.\_ St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk,\nand said—\n\n“Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.”\n\n“I will call Diana and Mary.”\n\n“No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.\_ Put\non your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the\nhead of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.”\n\nI know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my\ndealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between\nabsolute submission and determined revolt.\_ I have always faithfully\nobserved the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with\nvolcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances\nwarranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful\nobedience to St. John’s directions; and in ten minutes I was treading\nthe wild track of the glen, side by side with him.\n\nThe breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents\nof heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending\nthe ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and\nclear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the\nfirmament.\_ As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf,\nmossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white\nflower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills,\nmeantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to\ntheir very core.\n\n“Let us rest here,” said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of\na battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck\nrushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain\nshook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for\ngem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh\nfor the frowning—where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a\nlast refuge for silence.\n\nI took a seat: St. John stood near me.\_ He looked up the pass and down\nthe hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to\ntraverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let\nthe breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.\_ He seemed in communion with\nthe genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.\n\n“And I shall see it again,” he said aloud, “in dreams when I sleep by\nthe Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber\novercomes me—on the shore of a darker stream!”\n\nStrange words of a strange love!\_ An austere patriot’s passion for his\nfatherland!\_ He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to\nme nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced—\n\n“Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman\nwhich sails on the 20th of June.”\n\n“God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,” I answered.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “there is my glory and joy.\_ I am the servant of an\ninfallible Master.\_ I am not going out under human guidance, subject to\nthe defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my\nking, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.\_ It seems strange to\nme that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,—to\njoin in the same enterprise.”\n\n“All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish\nto march with the strong.”\n\n“I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as\nare worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.”\n\n“Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.”\n\n“You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge and\nexhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and why\nthey were given—to speak Heaven’s message in their ear,—to offer them,\ndirect from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.”\n\n“If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be\nthe first to inform them of it?”\n\nI felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I\ntrembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and\nrivet the spell.\n\n“And what does your heart say?” demanded St. John.\n\n“My heart is mute,—my heart is mute,” I answered, struck and thrilled.\n\n“Then I must speak for it,” continued the deep, relentless voice.\_\n“Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.”\n\nThe glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!\_ It was as if I had heard\na summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of\nMacedonia, had enounced, “Come over and help us!”\_ But I was no\napostle,—I could not behold the herald,—I could not receive his call.\n\n“Oh, St. John!” I cried, “have some mercy!”\n\nI appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,\nknew neither mercy nor remorse.\_ He continued—\n\n“God and nature intended you for a missionary’s wife.\_ It is not\npersonal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for\nlabour, not for love.\_ A missionary’s wife you must—shall be.\_ You shall\nbe mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s\nservice.”\n\n“I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,” I said.\n\nHe had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by\nthem.\_ Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his\narms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for\na long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to\nlast him to its close—resolved, however, that that close should be\nconquest for him.\n\n“Humility, Jane,” said he, “is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you\nsay right that you are not fit for the work.\_ Who is fit for it?\_ Or\nwho, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the\nsummons?\_ I, for instance, am but dust and ashes.\_ With St. Paul, I\nacknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this\nsense of my personal vileness to daunt me.\_ I know my Leader: that He is\njust as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to\nperform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His\nprovidence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.\_ Think like\nme, Jane—trust like me.\_ It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do\nnot doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.”\n\n“I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary\nlabours.”\n\n“There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you\nyour task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment\nto moment.\_ This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your\npowers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require\nmy help.”\n\n“But my powers—where are they for this undertaking?\_ I do not feel\nthem.\_ Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.\_ I am sensible of\nno light kindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering.\_\nOh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like\na rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths—the\nfear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!”\n\n“I have an answer for you—hear it.\_ I have watched you ever since we\nfirst met: I have made you my study for ten months.\_ I have proved you\nin that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?\_ In the\nvillage school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,\nlabour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could\nperform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.\_\nIn the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a\nmind clear of the vice of Demas:—lucre had no undue power over you.\_ In\nthe resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,\nkeeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the\nclaim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the\nflame and excitement of sacrifice.\_ In the tractability with which, at\nmy wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted\nanother because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which\nyou have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and unshaken\ntemper with which you have met its difficulties—I acknowledge the\ncomplement of the qualities I seek.\_ Jane, you are docile, diligent,\ndisinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very\nheroic: cease to mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly.\_ As a\nconductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your\nassistance will be to me invaluable.”\n\nMy iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure\nstep.\_ Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in\nmaking the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.\_ My\nwork, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed\nitself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping\nhand.\_ He waited for an answer.\_ I demanded a quarter of an hour to\nthink, before I again hazarded a reply.\n\n“Very willingly,” he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance\nup the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay\nstill.\n\n\n\n“I can do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge\nthat,” I meditated,—“that is, if life be spared me.\_ But I feel mine is\nnot the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.\_ What\nthen?\_ He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would\nresign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.\_ The\ncase is very plain before me.\_ In leaving England, I should leave a\nloved but empty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what\nis, what can that ever be to me?\_ My business is to live without him\nnow: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I\nwere waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might\nreunite me to him.\_ Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek\nanother interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation\nhe now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign?\_\nIs it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best\ncalculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished\nhopes?\_ I believe I must say, Yes—and yet I shudder.\_ Alas!\_ If I join\nSt. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature\ndeath.\_ And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and\nIndia for the grave, be filled?\_ Oh, I know well!\_ That, too, is very\nclear to my vision.\_ By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews\nache, I shall satisfy him—to the finest central point and farthest\noutward circle of his expectations.\_ If I do go with him—if I do\nmake the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all\non the altar—heart, vitals, the entire victim.\_ He will never love me;\nbut he shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen,\nresources he has never suspected.\_ Yes, I can work as hard as he can,\nand with as little grudging.\n\n“Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item—one dreadful\nitem.\_ It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a\nhusband’s heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which\nthe stream is foaming in yonder gorge.\_ He prizes me as a soldier would\na good weapon; and that is all.\_ Unmarried to him, this would never\ngrieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations—coolly put into\npractice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony?\_ Can I receive from\nhim the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he\nwould scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?\_\nCan I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a\nsacrifice made on principle?\_ No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.\_\nI will never undergo it.\_ As his sister, I might accompany him—not as\nhis wife: I will tell him so.”\n\nI looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;\nhis face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.\_ He started to\nhis feet and approached me.\n\n“I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.”\n\n“Your answer requires a commentary,” he said; “it is not clear.”\n\n“You have hitherto been my adopted brother—I, your adopted sister: let\nus continue as such: you and I had better not marry.”\n\nHe shook his head.\_ “Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.\_ If\nyou were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and\nseek no wife.\_ But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and\nsealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose\nthemselves to any other plan.\_ Do you not see it, Jane?\_ Consider a\nmoment—your strong sense will guide you.”\n\nI did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to\nthe fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and\ntherefore it inferred we ought not to marry.\_ I said so.\_ “St. John,” I\nreturned, “I regard you as a brother—you, me as a sister: so let us\ncontinue.”\n\n“We cannot—we cannot,” he answered, with short, sharp determination: “it\nwould not do.\_ You have said you will go with me to India: remember—you\nhave said that.”\n\n“Conditionally.”\n\n“Well—well.\_ To the main point—the departure with me from England, the\nco-operation with me in my future labours—you do not object.\_ You have\nalready as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent\nto withdraw it.\_ You have but one end to keep in view—how the work you\nhave undertaken can best be done.\_ Simplify your complicated interests,\nfeelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one\npurpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of your\ngreat Master.\_ To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that\nis a loose tie—but a husband.\_ I, too, do not want a sister: a sister\nmight any day be taken from me.\_ I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can\ninfluence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.”\n\nI shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold on\nmy limbs.\n\n“Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.”\n\n“One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation.\_ Again I tell\nyou it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with\nthe man’s selfish senses—I wish to mate: it is the missionary.”\n\n“And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but not\nmyself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.\_ For\nthem he has no use: I retain them.”\n\n“You cannot—you ought not.\_ Do you think God will be satisfied with half\nan oblation?\_ Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?\_ It is the cause of\nGod I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.\_ I cannot accept\non His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.”\n\n“Oh!\_ I will give my heart to God,” I said.\_ “You do not want it.”\n\nI will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed\nsarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the\nfeeling that accompanied it.\_ I had silently feared St. John till now,\nbecause I had not understood him.\_ He had held me in awe, because he had\nheld me in doubt.\_ How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could\nnot heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:\nthe analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.\_ I saw his\nfallibilities: I comprehended them.\_ I understood that, sitting there\nwhere I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before\nme, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.\_ The veil fell from his\nhardness and despotism.\_ Having felt in him the presence of these\nqualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage.\_ I was with an\nequal—one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might\nresist.\n\nHe was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently\nrisked an upward glance at his countenance.\n\nHis eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.\_\n“Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to me!” it seemed to say.\_ “What\ndoes this signify?”\n\n“Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,” he said ere long;\n“one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.\_ I\ntrust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart\nto God: it is all I want.\_ Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it\non your Maker, the advancement of that Maker’s spiritual kingdom on\nearth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do\nat once whatever furthers that end.\_ You will see what impetus would be\ngiven to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in\nmarriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity\nto the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all\nminor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all\nscruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal\ninclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once.”\n\n“Shall I?” I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in\ntheir harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his\nbrow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and\nsearching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied\nmyself in idea his wife.\_ Oh! it would never do!\_ As his curate, his\ncomrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that\ncapacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that\noffice; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;\naccommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his\nineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:\nprofoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.\_ I should\nsuffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body\nwould be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be\nfree.\_ I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural\nunenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.\_\nThere would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he\nnever came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his\nausterity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample\ndown: but as his wife—at his side always, and always restrained, and\nalways checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to\ncompel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned\nflame consumed vital after vital—this would be unendurable.\n\n“St. John!” I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.\n\n“Well?” he answered icily.\n\n“I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but\nnot as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.”\n\n“A part of me you must become,” he answered steadily; “otherwise the\nwhole bargain is void.\_ How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with\nme to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?\_ How can we\nbe for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage\ntribes—and unwed?”\n\n“Very well,” I said shortly; “under the circumstances, quite as well as\nif I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like\nyourself.”\n\n“It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:\nto attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.\_ And\nfor the rest, though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a woman’s\nheart and—it would not do.”\n\n“It would do,” I affirmed with some disdain, “perfectly well.\_ I have a\nwoman’s heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a\ncomrade’s constancy; a fellow-soldier’s frankness, fidelity, fraternity,\nif you like; a neophyte’s respect and submission to his hierophant:\nnothing more—don’t fear.”\n\n“It is what I want,” he said, speaking to himself; “it is just what I\nwant.\_ And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.\_\nJane, you would not repent marrying me—be certain of that; we must be\nmarried.\_ I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of\nlove would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your\neyes.”\n\n“I scorn your idea of love,” I could not help saying, as I rose up and\nstood before him, leaning my back against the rock.\_ “I scorn the\ncounterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you\noffer it.”\n\nHe looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.\_\nWhether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:\nhe could command his countenance thoroughly.\n\n“I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,” he said: “I\nthink I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.”\n\nI was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.\n\n“Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have\nbeen roused to speak so unguardedly.\_ You have introduced a topic on\nwhich our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the\nvery name of love is an apple of discord between us.\_ If the reality\nwere required, what should we do?\_ How should we feel?\_ My dear cousin,\nabandon your scheme of marriage—forget it.”\n\n“No,” said he; “it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which\ncan secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.\_\nTo-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom\nI should wish to say farewell.\_ I shall be absent a fortnight—take that\nspace of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject\nit, it is not me you deny, but God.\_ Through my means, He opens to you a\nnoble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.\_ Refuse to be my\nwife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and\nbarren obscurity.\_ Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with\nthose who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!”\n\nHe had done.\_ Turning from me, he once more\n\n“Looked to river, looked to hill.”\n\n\nBut this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy\nto hear them uttered.\_ As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in\nhis iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an\naustere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected\nsubmission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has\ndetected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to\nsympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into\nobedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with\nmy perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and\nrepentance.\n\nThat night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget\neven to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.\_ I—who,\nthough I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by the marked\nomission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.\n\n“I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,” said Diana,\n“during your walk on the moor.\_ But go after him; he is now lingering in\nthe passage expecting you—he will make it up.”\n\nI have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be\nhappy than dignified; and I ran after him—he stood at the foot of the\nstairs.\n\n“Good-night, St. John,” said I.\n\n“Good-night, Jane,” he replied calmly.\n\n“Then shake hands,” I added.\n\nWhat a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!\_ He was deeply\ndispleased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor\ntears move him.\_ No happy reconciliation was to be had with him—no\ncheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and\nplacid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was\nnot in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had\nnothing to forgive, not having been offended.\n\nAnd with that answer he left me.\_ I would much rather he had knocked me\ndown.\n"
