title: "\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nA splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant\nas were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our\nwave-girt land.\_ It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the\nSouth, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest\nthem on the cliffs of Albion.\_ The hay was all got in; the fields round\nThornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees\nwere in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted,\ncontrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.\n\nOn Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay\nLane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.\_ I watched her drop\nasleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.\n\nIt was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—“Day its fervid fires\nhad wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.\_\nWhere the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of\nclouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and\nfurnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and\nwide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.\_ The east had its own\ncharm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary\nstar: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.\n\nI walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that of\na cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a\nhandbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the\norchard.\_ No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it\nwas full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out\nfrom the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it\nfrom the lawn.\_ At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from\nlonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in\na giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the\nfence.\_ Here one could wander unseen.\_ While such honey-dew fell, such\nsilence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such\nshade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the\nupper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising\nmoon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed—not by sound, not\nby sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.\n\nSweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been\nyielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither\nof shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester’s cigar.\_\nI look round and I listen.\_ I see trees laden with ripening fruit.\_ I\nhear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is\nvisible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must\nflee.\_ I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr.\nRochester entering.\_ I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay\nlong: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will\nnever see me.\n\nBut no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden\nas attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree\nbranches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are\nladen; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a\nknot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the\ndew-beads on their petals.\_ A great moth goes humming by me; it alights\non a plant at Mr. Rochester’s foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.\n\n“Now, he has his back towards me,” thought I, “and he is occupied too;\nperhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.”\n\nI trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might\nnot betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant\nfrom where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.\_ “I shall get\nby very well,” I meditated.\_ As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over\nthe garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without\nturning—\n\n“Jane, come and look at this fellow.”\n\nI had made no noise: he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel?\_ I\nstarted at first, and then I approached him.\n\n“Look at his wings,” said he, “he reminds me rather of a West Indian\ninsect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in\nEngland; there! he is flown.”\n\nThe moth roamed away.\_ I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.\nRochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said—\n\n“Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and\nsurely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with\nmoonrise.”\n\nIt is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough\nat an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an\nexcuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word\nor plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful\nembarrassment.\_ I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.\nRochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to\nallege for leaving him.\_ I followed with lagging step, and thoughts\nbusily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked\nso composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any\nconfusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to\nlie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.\n\n“Jane,” he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly\nstrayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,\n“Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“You must have become in some degree attached to the house,—you, who\nhave an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of\nAdhesiveness?”\n\n“I am attached to it, indeed.”\n\n“And though I don’t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a\ndegree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even for\nsimple dame Fairfax?”\n\n“Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.”\n\n“And would be sorry to part with them?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Pity!” he said, and sighed and paused.\_ “It is always the way of events\nin this life,” he continued presently: “no sooner have you got settled\nin a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and\nmove on, for the hour of repose is expired.”\n\n“Must I move on, sir?” I asked.\_ “Must I leave Thornfield?”\n\n“I believe you must, Jane.\_ I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you\nmust.”\n\nThis was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.\n\n“Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.”\n\n“It is come now—I must give it to-night.”\n\n“Then you are going to be married, sir?”\n\n“Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail\nstraight on the head.”\n\n“Soon, sir?”\n\n“Very soon, my—that is, Miss Eyre: and you’ll remember, Jane, the first\ntime I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to\nput my old bachelor’s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy\nestate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she’s an\nextensive armful: but that’s not to the point—one can’t have too much of\nsuch a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was\nsaying—listen to me, Jane!\_ You’re not turning your head to look after\nmore moths, are you?\_ That was only a lady-clock, child, ‘flying away\nhome.’\_ I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with\nthat discretion I respect in you—with that foresight, prudence, and\nhumility which befit your responsible and dependent position—that in\ncase I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adèle had better trot\nforthwith.\_ I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on\nthe character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I’ll\ntry to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I\nhave made it my law of action.\_ Adèle must go to school; and you, Miss\nEyre, must get a new situation.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—” I was\ngoing to say, “I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to\nbetake myself to:” but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long\nsentence, for my voice was not quite under command.\n\n“In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,” continued Mr. Rochester;\n“and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an\nasylum for you.”\n\n“Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give—”\n\n“Oh, no need to apologise!\_ I consider that when a dependent does her\nduty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her\nemployer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her;\nindeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place\nthat I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five\ndaughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,\nIreland.\_ You’ll like Ireland, I think: they’re such warm-hearted people\nthere, they say.”\n\n“It is a long way off, sir.”\n\n“No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the\ndistance.”\n\n“Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—”\n\n“From what, Jane?”\n\n“From England and from Thornfield: and—”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“From you, sir.”\n\nI said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free\nwill, my tears gushed out.\_ I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I\navoided sobbing.\_ The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck\ncold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,\ndestined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side\nI now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth,\ncaste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably\nloved.\n\n“It is a long way,” I again said.\n\n“It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,\nIreland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that’s morally certain.\_ I\nnever go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the\ncountry.\_ We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the\nlittle time that remains to them close to each other.\_ Come! we’ll talk\nover the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the\nstars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the\nchestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.\_ Come, we will sit\nthere in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit\nthere together.”\_ He seated me and himself.\n\n“It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little\nfriend on such weary travels: but if I can’t do better, how is it to be\nhelped?\_ Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?”\n\nI could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.\n\n“Because,” he said, “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to\nyou—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string\nsomewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a\nsimilar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little\nframe.\_ And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of\nland come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be\nsnapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding\ninwardly.\_ As for you,—you’d forget me.”\n\n“That I never should, sir: you know—”\_ Impossible to proceed.\n\n“Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?\_ Listen!”\n\nIn listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured\nno longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot\nwith acute distress.\_ When I did speak, it was only to express an\nimpetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.\n\n“Because you are sorry to leave it?”\n\nThe vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was\nclaiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to\npredominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—and to\nspeak.\n\n“I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I\nhave lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least.\_ I\nhave not been trampled on.\_ I have not been petrified.\_ I have not been\nburied with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion\nwith what is bright and energetic and high.\_ I have talked, face to\nface, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an original, a\nvigorous, an expanded mind.\_ I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it\nstrikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn\nfrom you for ever.\_ I see the necessity of departure; and it is like\nlooking on the necessity of death.”\n\n“Where do you see the necessity?” he asked suddenly.\n\n“Where?\_ You, sir, have placed it before me.”\n\n“In what shape?”\n\n“In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride.”\n\n“My bride!\_ What bride?\_ I have no bride!”\n\n“But you will have.”\n\n“Yes;—I will!—I will!”\_ He set his teeth.\n\n“Then I must go:—you have said it yourself.”\n\n“No: you must stay!\_ I swear it—and the oath shall be kept.”\n\n“I tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion.\_\n“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?\_ Do you think I am an\nautomaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of\nbread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my\ncup?\_ Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am\nsoulless and heartless?\_ You think wrong!—I have as much soul as\nyou,—and full as much heart!\_ And if God had gifted me with some beauty\nand much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as\nit is now for me to leave you.\_ I am not talking to you now through the\nmedium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my\nspirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through\nthe grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!”\n\n“As we are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—“so,” he added, enclosing me in his\narms.\_ Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: “so,\nJane!”\n\n“Yes, so, sir,” I rejoined: “and yet not so; for you are a married\nman—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you—to one\nwith whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love; for\nI have seen and heard you sneer at her.\_ I would scorn such a union:\ntherefore I am better than you—let me go!”\n\n“Where, Jane?\_ To Ireland?”\n\n“Yes—to Ireland.\_ I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.”\n\n“Jane, be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is\nrending its own plumage in its desperation.”\n\n“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an\nindependent will, which I now exert to leave you.”\n\nAnother effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.\n\n“And your will shall decide your destiny,” he said: “I offer you my\nhand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.”\n\n“You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.”\n\n“I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and\nbest earthly companion.”\n\n“For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.”\n\n“Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still\ntoo.”\n\nA waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through\nthe boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite\ndistance—it died.\_ The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the\nhour: in listening to it, I again wept.\_ Mr. Rochester sat quiet,\nlooking at me gently and seriously.\_ Some time passed before he spoke;\nhe at last said—\n\n“Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.”\n\n“I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot\nreturn.”\n\n“But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.”\n\nI was silent: I thought he mocked me.\n\n“Come, Jane—come hither.”\n\n“Your bride stands between us.”\n\nHe rose, and with a stride reached me.\n\n“My bride is here,” he said, again drawing me to him, “because my equal\nis here, and my likeness.\_ Jane, will you marry me?”\n\nStill I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I\nwas still incredulous.\n\n“Do you doubt me, Jane?”\n\n“Entirely.”\n\n“You have no faith in me?”\n\n“Not a whit.”\n\n“Am I a liar in your eyes?” he asked passionately.\_ “Little sceptic, you\nshall be convinced.\_ What love have I for Miss Ingram?\_ None: and that\nyou know.\_ What love has she for me?\_ None: as I have taken pains to\nprove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of\nwhat was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;\nit was coldness both from her and her mother.\_ I would not—I could\nnot—marry Miss Ingram.\_ You—you strange, you almost unearthly thing!—I\nlove as my own flesh.\_ You—poor and obscure, and small and plain as you\nare—I entreat to accept me as a husband.”\n\n“What, me!” I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness—and especially in\nhis incivility—to credit his sincerity: “me who have not a friend in the\nworld but you—if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have\ngiven me?”\n\n“You, Jane, I must have you for my own—entirely my own.\_ Will you be\nmine?\_ Say yes, quickly.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I want to read your countenance—turn!”\n\n“There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled,\nscratched page.\_ Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.”\n\nHis face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were\nstrong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.\n\n“Oh, Jane, you torture me!” he exclaimed.\_ “With that searching and yet\nfaithful and generous look, you torture me!”\n\n“How can I do that?\_ If you are true, and your offer real, my only\nfeelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture.”\n\n“Gratitude!” he ejaculated; and added wildly—“Jane accept me quickly.\_\nSay, Edward—give me my name—Edward—I will marry you.”\n\n“Are you in earnest?\_ Do you truly love me?\_ Do you sincerely wish me to\nbe your wife?”\n\n“I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.”\n\n“Then, sir, I will marry you.”\n\n“Edward—my little wife!”\n\n“Dear Edward!”\n\n“Come to me—come to me entirely now,” said he; and added, in his deepest\ntone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, “Make my\nhappiness—I will make yours.”\n\n“God pardon me!” he subjoined ere long; “and man meddle not with me: I\nhave her, and will hold her.”\n\n“There is no one to meddle, sir.\_ I have no kindred to interfere.”\n\n“No—that is the best of it,” he said.\_ And if I had loved him less I\nshould have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,\nsitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the\nparadise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so\nabundant a flow.\_ Again and again he said, “Are you happy, Jane?”\_ And\nagain and again I answered, “Yes.”\_ After which he murmured, “It will\natone—it will atone.\_ Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and\ncomfortless?\_ Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?\_ Is there\nnot love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?\_ It will expiate at\nGod’s tribunal.\_ I know my Maker sanctions what I do.\_ For the world’s\njudgment—I wash my hands thereof.\_ For man’s opinion—I defy it.”\n\nBut what had befallen the night?\_ The moon was not yet set, and we were\nall in shadow: I could scarcely see my master’s face, near as I was.\_\nAnd what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind\nroared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.\n\n“We must go in,” said Mr. Rochester: “the weather changes.\_ I could have\nsat with thee till morning, Jane.”\n\n“And so,” thought I, “could I with you.”\_ I should have said so,\nperhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was\nlooking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and\nI thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester’s\nshoulder.\n\nThe rain rushed down.\_ He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,\nand into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the\nthreshold.\_ He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the\nwater out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.\_\nI did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.\_ The lamp was\nlit.\_ The clock was on the stroke of twelve.\n\n“Hasten to take off your wet things,” said he; “and before you go,\ngood-night—good-night, my darling!”\n\nHe kissed me repeatedly.\_ When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there\nstood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.\_ I only smiled at her, and ran\nupstairs.\_ “Explanation will do for another time,” thought I.\_ Still,\nwhen I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even\ntemporarily misconstrue what she had seen.\_ But joy soon effaced every\nother feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder\ncrashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as\nthe rain fell during a storm of two hours’ duration, I experienced no\nfear and little awe.\_ Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course\nof it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was\nstrength for anything.\n\nBefore I left my bed in the morning, little Adèle came running in to\ntell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had\nbeen struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.\n"
