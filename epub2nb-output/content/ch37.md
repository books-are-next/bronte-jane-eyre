title: "\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nHe did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.\_\nHe deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me\nfeel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet\nimplacable man can inflict on one who has offended him.\_ Without one\novert act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me\nmomently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his\nfavour.\n\nNot that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not\nthat he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in\nhis power to do so.\_ Both by nature and principle, he was superior to\nthe mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I\nscorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as\nlong as he and I lived he never would forget them.\_ I saw by his look,\nwhen he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between\nme and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and\ntheir echo toned every answer he gave me.\n\nHe did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual\neach morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within\nhim had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian,\nin evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking\napparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the\nspirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a\ncertain austere charm to his language and manner.\_ To me, he was in\nreality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright,\nblue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.\n\nAll this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture.\_ It kept up a\nslow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which\nharassed and crushed me altogether.\_ I felt how—if I were his wife, this\ngood man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without\ndrawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own\ncrystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.\_ Especially I felt this\nwhen I made any attempt to propitiate him.\_ No ruth met my ruth.\_ He\nexperienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after\nreconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears\nblistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect\non him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.\_ To\nhis sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid\nthat mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I\nwas banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am\nsure he did not by force, but on principle.\n\nThe night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the\ngarden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,\nalienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near\nrelations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.\_\nI went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate;\nI spoke to the point at once.\n\n“St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.\_ Let us be\nfriends.”\n\n“I hope we are friends,” was the unmoved reply; while he still watched\nthe rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.\n\n“No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.\_ You know that.”\n\n“Are we not?\_ That is wrong.\_ For my part, I wish you no ill and all\ngood.”\n\n“I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any\none ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of\naffection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere\nstrangers.”\n\n“Of course,” he said.\_ “Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from\nregarding you as a stranger.”\n\nThis, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling\nenough.\_ Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should\nimmediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly\nthan those feelings could.\_ I deeply venerated my cousin’s talent and\nprinciple.\_ His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me\nseverely.\_ I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.\n\n“Must we part in this way, St. John?\_ And when you go to India, will you\nleave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?”\n\nHe now turned quite from the moon and faced me.\n\n“When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!\_ What! do you not go to\nIndia?”\n\n“You said I could not unless I married you.”\n\n“And you will not marry me!\_ You adhere to that resolution?”\n\nReader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into\nthe ice of their questions?\_ How much of the fall of the avalanche is in\ntheir anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?\n\n“No.\_ St. John, I will not marry you.\_ I adhere to my resolution.”\n\nThe avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet\ncrash down.\n\n“Once more, why this refusal?” he asked.\n\n“Formerly,” I answered, “because you did not love me; now, I reply,\nbecause you almost hate me.\_ If I were to marry you, you would kill me.\_\nYou are killing me now.”\n\nHis lips and cheeks turned white—quite white.\n\n“I should kill you—I am killing you?\_ Your words are such as\nought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.\_ They betray an\nunfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem\ninexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even\nuntil seventy-and-seven times.”\n\nI had finished the business now.\_ While earnestly wishing to erase from\nhis mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious\nsurface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.\n\n“Now you will indeed hate me,” I said.\_ “It is useless to attempt to\nconciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.”\n\nA fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched\non the truth.\_ That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.\_ I knew\nthe steely ire I had whetted.\_ I was heart-wrung.\n\n“You utterly misinterpret my words,” I said, at once seizing his hand:\n“I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not.”\n\nMost bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.\_\n“And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I\npresume?” said he, after a considerable pause.\n\n“Yes, I will, as your assistant,” I answered.\n\nA very long silence succeeded.\_ What struggle there was in him between\nNature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams\nscintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.\_ He\nspoke at last.\n\n“I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age\nproposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.\_ I proved it to you\nin such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever\nagain alluding to the plan.\_ That you have done so, I regret—for your\nsake.”\n\nI interrupted him.\_ Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at\nonce.\_ “Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.\_\nYou pretend to be shocked by what I have said.\_ You are not really\nshocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or\nso conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.\_ I say again, I will be\nyour curate, if you like, but never your wife.”\n\nAgain he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion\nperfectly.\_ He answered emphatically but calmly—\n\n“A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.\_ With me,\nthen, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I\nwill, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a\ncoadjutor.\_ Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society’s\naid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your\npromise and deserting the band you engaged to join.”\n\nNow I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or\nentered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and\nmuch too despotic for the occasion.\_ I replied—\n\n“There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.\_\nI am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with\nstrangers.\_ With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,\nconfide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go\nwhen and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.”\n\n“Ah! you are afraid of yourself,” he said, curling his lip.\n\n“I am.\_ God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish\nme would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.\_\nMoreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know\nfor certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than\nby leaving it.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on\nwhich I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by\nsome means that doubt is removed.”\n\n“I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.\_ The interest you\ncherish is lawless and unconsecrated.\_ Long since you ought to have\ncrushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.\_ You think of Mr.\nRochester?”\n\nIt was true.\_ I confessed it by silence.\n\n“Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“I must find out what is become of him.”\n\n“It remains for me, then,” he said, “to remember you in my prayers, and\nto entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed\nbecome a castaway.\_ I had thought I recognised in you one of the\nchosen.\_ But God sees not as man sees: His will be done—”\n\nHe opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.\_\nHe was soon out of sight.\n\nOn re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window,\nlooking very thoughtful.\_ Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put\nher hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.\n\n“Jane,” she said, “you are always agitated and pale now.\_ I am sure\nthere is something the matter.\_ Tell me what business St. John and you\nhave on hands.\_ I have watched you this half hour from the window; you\nmust forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I\nhardly know what.\_ St. John is a strange being—”\n\nShe paused—I did not speak: soon she resumed—\n\n“That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting\nyou, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest\nhe never showed to any one else—to what end?\_ I wish he loved you—does\nhe, Jane?”\n\nI put her cool hand to my hot forehead; “No, Die, not one whit.”\n\n“Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently\nalone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?\_ Mary and I had\nboth concluded he wished you to marry him.”\n\n“He does—he has asked me to be his wife.”\n\nDiana clapped her hands.\_ “That is just what we hoped and thought!\_ And\nyou will marry him, Jane, won’t you?\_ And then he will stay in England.”\n\n“Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a\nfitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.”\n\n“What!\_ He wishes you to go to India?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Madness!” she exclaimed.\_ “You would not live three months there, I am\ncertain.\_ You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?”\n\n“I have refused to marry him—”\n\n“And have consequently displeased him?” she suggested.\n\n“Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany\nhim as his sister.”\n\n“It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.\_ Think of the task you\nundertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,\nand you are weak.\_ St. John—you know him—would urge you to\nimpossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during\nthe hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts,\nyou force yourself to perform.\_ I am astonished you found courage to\nrefuse his hand.\_ You do not love him then, Jane?”\n\n“Not as a husband.”\n\n“Yet he is a handsome fellow.”\n\n“And I am so plain, you see, Die.\_ We should never suit.”\n\n“Plain!\_ You?\_ Not at all.\_ You are much too pretty, as well as too\ngood, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.”\_ And again she earnestly\nconjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.\n\n“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of\nserving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of\ndecency.\_ He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing\nto accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find\nin him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.”\n\n“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?”\n\n“You should hear himself on the subject.\_ He has again and again\nexplained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.\_ He\nhas told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no\ndoubt.\_ But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that\nI am not formed for marriage.\_ Would it not be strange, Die, to be\nchained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?”\n\n“Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!”\n\n“And then,” I continued, “though I have only sisterly affection for him\nnow, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of\nconceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,\nbecause he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur\nin his look, manner, and conversation.\_ In that case, my lot would\nbecome unspeakably wretched.\_ He would not want me to love him; and if I\nshowed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,\nunrequired by him, unbecoming in me.\_ I know he would.”\n\n“And yet St. John is a good man,” said Diana.\n\n“He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings\nand claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.\_ It is\nbetter, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest,\nin his progress, he should trample them down.\_ Here he comes!\_ I will\nleave you, Diana.”\_ And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the\ngarden.\n\nBut I was forced to meet him again at supper.\_ During that meal he\nappeared just as composed as usual.\_ I had thought he would hardly speak\nto me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial\nscheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.\_ He addressed\nme precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his\nordinary manner—one scrupulously polite.\_ No doubt he had invoked the\nhelp of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now\nbelieved he had forgiven me once more.\n\nFor the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first\nchapter of Revelation.\_ It was at all times pleasant to listen while\nfrom his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice\nsound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so\nimpressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of\nGod: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more\nthrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the\nMay moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost\nunnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,\nbending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision\nof the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come to dwell\nwith men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised\nthat there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any\nmore pain, because the former things were passed away.\n\nThe succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially\nas I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in\nuttering them, his eye had turned on me.\n\n“He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and\nhe shall be my son.\_ But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the fearful,\nthe unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth\nwith fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”\n\nHenceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.\n\nA calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his\nenunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.\_ The reader\nbelieved his name was already written in the Lamb’s book of life, and he\nyearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the\nkings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of\nsun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and\nthe Lamb is the light thereof.\n\nIn the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his\nstern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and\nresolved on a conquest.\_ He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted;\nguidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh\nhour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were\nluring from the narrow path.\_ He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of\na brand snatched from the burning.\_ Earnestness is ever deeply solemn:\nfirst, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it\ncontinued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.\_ He felt the\ngreatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him\nplead for it, could not but feel it too.\n\nThe prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour\nin the morning.\_ Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in\ncompliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,\nand wished him a pleasant journey.\n\n“Thank you, Jane.\_ As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a\nfortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.\_ If I\nlistened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with\nme; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to\ndo all things to the glory of God.\_ My Master was long-suffering: so\nwill I be.\_ I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:\nrepent—resolve, while there is yet time.\_ Remember, we are bid to work\nwhile it is day—warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’\_\nRemember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.\_ God\ngive you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken\nfrom you!”\n\nHe laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.\_ He had spoken\nearnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding\nhis mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering\nsheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is\nresponsible.\_ All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;\nwhether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be\nsincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.\_ I felt\nveneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me\nat once to the point I had so long shunned.\_ I was tempted to cease\nstruggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf\nof his existence, and there lose my own.\_ I was almost as hard beset by\nhim now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.\_ I\nwas a fool both times.\_ To have yielded then would have been an error of\nprinciple; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.\_ So\nI think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet\nmedium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.\n\nI stood motionless under my hierophant’s touch.\_ My refusals were\nforgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralysed.\_ The\nImpossible—i.e., my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the\nPossible.\_ All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.\_ Religion\ncalled—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a\nscroll—death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that\nfor safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.\_\nThe dim room was full of visions.\n\n“Could you decide now?” asked the missionary.\_ The inquiry was put in\ngentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.\_ Oh, that gentleness! how far\nmore potent is it than force!\_ I could resist St. John’s wrath: I grew\npliant as a reed under his kindness.\_ Yet I knew all the time, if I\nyielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my\nformer rebellion.\_ His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn\nprayer: it was only elevated.\n\n“I could decide if I were but certain,” I answered: “were I but\nconvinced that it is God’s will I should marry you, I could vow to marry\nyou here and now—come afterwards what would!”\n\n“My prayers are heard!” ejaculated St. John.\_ He pressed his hand firmer\non my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, almost\nas if he loved me (I say almost—I knew the difference—for I had felt\nwhat it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the\nquestion, and thought only of duty).\_ I contended with my inward dimness\nof vision, before which clouds yet rolled.\_ I sincerely, deeply,\nfervently longed to do what was right; and only that.\_ “Show me, show me\nthe path!” I entreated of Heaven.\_ I was excited more than I had ever\nbeen; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader\nshall judge.\n\nAll the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,\nwere now retired to rest.\_ The one candle was dying out: the room was\nfull of moonlight.\_ My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.\_\nSuddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it\nthrough, and passed at once to my head and extremities.\_ The feeling was\nnot like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as\nstartling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto\nhad been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to\nwake.\_ They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered\non my bones.\n\n“What have you heard?\_ What do you see?” asked St. John.\_ I saw nothing,\nbut I heard a voice somewhere cry—\n\n“Jane!\_ Jane!\_ Jane!”—nothing more.\n\n“O God! what is it?” I gasped.\n\nI might have said, “Where is it?” for it did not seem in the room—nor in\nthe house—nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor from\nunder the earth—nor from overhead.\_ I had heard it—where, or whence, for\never impossible to know!\_ And it was the voice of a human being—a known,\nloved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it\nspoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.\n\n“I am coming!” I cried.\_ “Wait for me!\_ Oh, I will come!”\_ I flew to the\ndoor and looked into the passage: it was dark.\_ I ran out into the\ngarden: it was void.\n\n“Where are you?” I exclaimed.\n\nThe hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—“Where are\nyou?”\_ I listened.\_ The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland\nloneliness and midnight hush.\n\n“Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the\nblack yew at the gate.\_ “This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:\nit is the work of nature.\_ She was roused, and did—no miracle—but her\nbest.”\n\nI broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.\_ It\nwas my time to assume ascendency.\_ My powers were in play and in\nforce.\_ I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave\nme: I must and would be alone.\_ He obeyed at once.\_ Where there is\nenergy to command well enough, obedience never fails.\_ I mounted to my\nchamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way—a\ndifferent way to St. John’s, but effective in its own fashion.\_ I seemed\nto penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in\ngratitude at His feet.\_ I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve—and\nlay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight.\n"
