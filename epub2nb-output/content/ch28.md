title: "\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nSophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in\naccomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,\nimpatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.\_ She was just\nfastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with\na brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.\n\n“Stop!” she cried in French.\_ “Look at yourself in the mirror: you have\nnot taken one peep.”\n\nSo I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my\nusual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.\_ “Jane!”\ncalled a voice, and I hastened down.\_ I was received at the foot of the\nstairs by Mr. Rochester.\n\n“Lingerer!” he said, “my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry\nso long!”\n\nHe took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced\nme “fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire\nof his eyes,” and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to\neat some breakfast, he rang the bell.\_ One of his lately hired servants,\na footman, answered it.\n\n“Is John getting the carriage ready?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Is the luggage brought down?”\n\n“They are bringing it down, sir.”\n\n“Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are\nthere: return and tell me.”\n\nThe church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the\nfootman soon returned.\n\n“Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.”\n\n“And the carriage?”\n\n“The horses are harnessing.”\n\n“We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment\nwe return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the\ncoachman in his seat.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Jane, are you ready?”\n\nI rose.\_ There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait\nfor or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.\_ Mrs. Fairfax stood in the\nhall as we passed.\_\_ I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was\nheld by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly\nfollow; and to look at Mr. Rochester’s face was to feel that not a\nsecond of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.\_ I wonder what other\nbridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly\nresolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming\nand flashing eyes.\n\nI know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I\ngazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both\nseemed migrated into Mr. Rochester’s frame.\_ I wanted to see the\ninvisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a\nglance fierce and fell.\_ I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he\nseemed breasting and resisting.\n\nAt the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of\nbreath.\_ “Am I cruel in my love?” he said.\_ “Delay an instant: lean on\nme, Jane.”\n\nAnd now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising\ncalm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning\nsky beyond.\_ I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I\nhave not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst\nthe low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy\nhead-stones.\_ I noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round\nto the back of the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by\nthe side-aisle door and witness the ceremony.\_ By Mr. Rochester they\nwere not observed; he was earnestly looking at my face from which the\nblood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and\nmy cheeks and lips cold.\_ When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked\ngently with me up the path to the porch.\n\nWe entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white\nsurplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.\_ All was still: two\nshadows only moved in a remote corner.\_ My conjecture had been correct:\nthe strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault\nof the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the\nold time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains\nof Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil\nwars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.\n\nOur place was taken at the communion rails.\_ Hearing a cautious step\nbehind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a gentleman,\nevidently—was advancing up the chancel.\_ The service began.\_ The\nexplanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the\nclergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.\nRochester, went on.\n\n“I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of\njudgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if\neither of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined\ntogether in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that\nso many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth allow,\nare not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful.”\n\nHe paused, as the custom is.\_ When is the pause after that sentence ever\nbroken by reply?\_ Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.\_ And the\nclergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his\nbreath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched\ntowards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou have this\nwoman for thy wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—\n\n“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”\n\nThe clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the\nsame; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under\nhis feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he\nsaid, “Proceed.”\n\nProfound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low\nintonation.\_ Presently Mr. Wood said—\n\n“I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been\nasserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.”\n\n“The ceremony is quite broken off,” subjoined the voice behind us.\_ “I\nam in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to\nthis marriage exists.”\n\nMr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making\nno movement but to possess himself of my hand.\_ What a hot and strong\ngrasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive\nfront at this moment!\_ How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild\nbeneath!\n\nMr. Wood seemed at a loss.\_ “What is the nature of the impediment?” he\nasked.\_ “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?”\n\n“Hardly,” was the answer.\_ “I have called it insuperable, and I speak\nadvisedly.”\n\nThe speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.\_ He continued,\nuttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—\n\n“It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.\_ Mr.\nRochester has a wife now living.”\n\nMy nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated\nto thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt\nfrost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.\_ I\nlooked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.\_ His whole face was\ncolourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.\_ He disavowed\nnothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things.\_ Without speaking,\nwithout smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he\nonly twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.\n\n“Who are you?” he asked of the intruder.\n\n“My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London.”\n\n“And you would thrust on me a wife?”\n\n“I would remind you of your lady’s existence, sir, which the law\nrecognises, if you do not.”\n\n“Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her\nplace of abode.”\n\n“Certainly.”\_ Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read\nout in a sort of official, nasal voice:—\n\n“‘I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of\nfifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in\nthe county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was\nmarried to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,\nmerchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish\nTown, Jamaica.\_ The record of the marriage will be found in the register\nof that church—a copy of it is now in my possession.\_ Signed, Richard\nMason.’”\n\n“That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does\nnot prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.”\n\n“She was living three months ago,” returned the lawyer.\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will\nscarcely controvert.”\n\n“Produce him—or go to hell.”\n\n“I will produce him first—he is on the spot.\_ Mr. Mason, have the\ngoodness to step forward.”\n\nMr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too,\na sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the\nspasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.\_ The second\nstranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a\npale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason\nhimself.\_ Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.\_ His eye, as I have\noften said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in\nits gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead\nreceived a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,\nlifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the\nchurch-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body—but\nMason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!”\_ Contempt fell cool on\nMr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he\nonly asked—“What have you to say?”\n\nAn inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.\n\n“The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.\_ I again demand,\nwhat have you to say?”\n\n“Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a sacred\nplace.”\_ Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you aware, sir,\nwhether or not this gentleman’s wife is still living?”\n\n“Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”\n\n“She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate\ntones: “I saw her there last April.\_ I am her brother.”\n\n“At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman.\_ “Impossible!\_ I am an\nold resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.\nRochester at Thornfield Hall.”\n\nI saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester’s lips, and he muttered—\n\n“No, by God!\_ I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under\nthat name.”\_ He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he\nformed his resolve, and announced it—\n\n“Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.\_\nWood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the\nclerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.”\_ The man\nobeyed.\n\nMr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly\nword!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred\nme, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last.\_ I am little better\nthan a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,\ndeserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless\nfire and deathless worm.\_ Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this\nlawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to\nwhom I was married lives!\_ You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester\nat the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time\ninclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there\nunder watch and ward.\_ Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard\nhalf-sister: some, my cast-off mistress.\_ I now inform you that she is\nmy wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name; sister\nof this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and\nwhite cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear.\_ Cheer up,\nDick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you.\_ Bertha\nMason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through\nthree generations!\_ Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a\ndrunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were\nsilent on family secrets before.\_ Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied\nher parent in both points.\_ I had a charming partner—pure, wise, modest:\nyou can fancy I was a happy man.\_ I went through rich scenes!\_ Oh! my\nexperience has been heavenly, if you only knew it!\_ But I owe you no\nfurther explanation.\_ Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up\nto the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and my wife!\_ You shall\nsee what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether\nor not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with\nsomething at least human.\_ This girl,” he continued, looking at me,\n“knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all\nwas fair and legal and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a\nfeigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and\nembruted partner!\_ Come all of you—follow!”\n\nStill holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came\nafter.\_ At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.\n\n“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it\nwill not be wanted to-day.”\n\nAt our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and\ngreet us.\n\n“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your\ncongratulations!\_ Who wants them?\_ Not I!—they are fifteen years too\nlate!”\n\nHe passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still\nbeckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.\_ We mounted the\nfirst staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:\nthe low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us\nto the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\n\n“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you\nhere.”\n\nHe lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,\ntoo, he opened.\_ In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded\nby a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a\nchain.\_ Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in\na saucepan.\_ In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure\nran backwards and forwards.\_ What it was, whether beast or human being,\none could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all\nfours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was\ncovered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a\nmane, hid its head and face.\n\n“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester.\_ “How are you? and how is\nyour charge to-day?”\n\n“We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling\nmess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ‘rageous.”\n\nA fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the\nclothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.\n\n“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”\n\n“Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”\n\n“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”\n\nThe maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and\ngazed wildly at her visitors.\_ I recognised well that purple face,—those\nbloated features.\_ Mrs. Poole advanced.\n\n“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she has\nno knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”\n\n“One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in\nmortal discretion to fathom her craft.”\n\n“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.\n\n“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.\n\n“‘Ware!” cried Grace.\_ The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.\_\nMr. Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his\nthroat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.\_ She\nwas a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent\nbesides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she\nalmost throttled him, athletic as he was.\_ He could have settled her\nwith a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only\nwrestle.\_ At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and\nhe pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound\nher to a chair.\_ The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells\nand the most convulsive plunges.\_ Mr. Rochester then turned to the\nspectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.\n\n“That is my wife,” said he.\_ “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am\never to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure\nhours!\_ And this is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my\nshoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth\nof hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her\njust as a change after that fierce ragout.\_ Wood and Briggs, look at the\ndifference!\_ Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this\nface with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of\nthe gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge\nye shall be judged!\_ Off with you now.\_ I must shut up my prize.”\n\nWe all withdrew.\_ Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some\nfurther order to Grace Poole.\_ The solicitor addressed me as he\ndescended the stair.\n\n“You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be\nglad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason\nreturns to Madeira.”\n\n“My uncle!\_ What of him?\_ Do you know him?”\n\n“Mr. Mason does.\_ Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his\nhouse for some years.\_ When your uncle received your letter intimating\nthe contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,\nwho was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to\nJamaica, happened to be with him.\_ Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;\nfor he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the\nname of Rochester.\_ Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may\nsuppose, revealed the real state of matters.\_ Your uncle, I am sorry to\nsay, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his\ndisease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will\never rise.\_ He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate\nyou from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason\nto lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.\_ He\nreferred him to me for assistance.\_ I used all despatch, and am thankful\nI was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.\_ Were I not morally\ncertain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would\nadvise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had\nbetter remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of\nMr. Eyre.\_ Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.\n\n“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to\ntake leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.\_ The\nclergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or\nreproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.\n\nI heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which\nI had now withdrawn.\_ The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the\nbolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep, not to mourn, I\nwas yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off the wedding\ndress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I\nthought, for the last time.\_ I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.\_ I\nleaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.\_ And now I\nthought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved—followed up and down\nwhere I was led or dragged—watched event rush on event, disclosure open\nbeyond disclosure: but now, I thought.\n\nThe morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene\nwith the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;\nthere was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no\ndefiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a\ncalmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short\nquestions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence\nadduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;\nthen the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all\nwas over.\n\nI was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:\nnothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.\_ And yet where was\nthe Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her\nprospects?\n\nJane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was a\ncold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were\ndesolate.\_ A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December\nstorm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed\nthe blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes\nwhich last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with\nuntrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and\nflagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and\nwhite as pine-forests in wintry Norway.\_ My hopes were all dead—struck\nwith a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in\nthe land of Egypt.\_ I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so\nblooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could\nnever revive.\_ I looked at my love: that feeling which was my\nmaster’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering\nchild in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not\nseek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from his breast.\_\nOh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted—confidence\ndestroyed!\_ Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not\nwhat I had thought him.\_ I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not\nsay he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone\nfrom his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived\nwell.\_ When—how—whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I\ndoubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield.\_ Real affection, it seemed,\nhe could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was\nbalked; he would want me no more.\_ I should fear even to cross his path\nnow: my view must be hateful to him.\_ Oh, how blind had been my eyes!\_\nHow weak my conduct!\n\nMy eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round\nme, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.\_\nSelf-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down\nin the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote\nmountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I\nhad no strength.\_ I lay faint, longing to be dead.\_ One idea only still\nthrobbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered\nprayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as\nsomething that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express\nthem—\n\n“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”\n\nIt was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I\nhad neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it\ncame: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.\_ The whole\nconsciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith\ndeath-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.\_ That\nbitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my\nsoul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;\nthe floods overflowed me.”\n"
