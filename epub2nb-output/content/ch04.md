title: "\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nI resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which\ngreatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed\nto entertain of me.\_ The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or\nrather out of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a\nmoment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties,\nand, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to\ngo all lengths.\n\n“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.”\n\n“For shame! for shame!” cried the lady’s-maid.\_ “What shocking conduct,\nMiss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son!\_ Your\nyoung master.”\n\n“Master!\_ How is he my master?\_ Am I a servant?”\n\n“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.\_\nThere, sit down, and think over your wickedness.”\n\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,\nand had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a\nspring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\n\n“If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,” said Bessie.\_ “Miss\nAbbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.”\n\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.\_ This\npreparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a\nlittle of the excitement out of me.\n\n“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not stir.”\n\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\n\n“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was\nreally subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot\nstood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as\nincredulous of my sanity.\n\n“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\n\n“But it was always in her,” was the reply.\_ “I’ve told Missis often my\nopinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.\_ She’s an underhand\nlittle thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”\n\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—“You ought to\nbe aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps\nyou: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the\npoorhouse.”\n\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very\nfirst recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.\_ This\nreproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very\npainful and crushing, but only half intelligible.\_ Miss Abbot joined in—\n\n“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed\nand Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with\nthem.\_ They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it\nis your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to\nthem.”\n\n“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice,\n“you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have\na home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you\naway, I am sure.”\n\n“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her: He might strike her\ndead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?\_ Come,\nBessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything.\_ Say\nyour prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t\nrepent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and\nfetch you away.”\n\nThey went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\n\nThe red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say\nnever, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall\nrendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it\ncontained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the\nmansion.\_ A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with\ncurtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;\nthe two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half\nshrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;\nthe table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the\nwalls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,\nthe toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.\_ Out\nof these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the\npiled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy\nMarseilles counterpane.\_ Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned\neasy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before\nit; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.\n\nThis room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,\nbecause remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was\nknown to be so seldom entered.\_ The house-maid alone came here on\nSaturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet\ndust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the\ncontents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored\ndivers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased\nhusband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the\nspell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.\n\nMr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed\nhis last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the\nundertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration\nhad guarded it from frequent intrusion.\n\nMy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,\nwas a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;\nto my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken\nreflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled\nwindows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty\nof the bed and room.\_ I was not quite sure whether they had locked the\ndoor; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.\_ Alas! yes: no\njail was ever more secure.\_ Returning, I had to cross before the\nlooking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it\nrevealed.\_ All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in\nreality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white\nface and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving\nwhere all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it\nlike one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening\nstories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and\nappearing before the eyes of belated travellers.\_ I returned to my\nstool.\n\nSuperstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for\ncomplete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted\nslave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid\nrush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.\n\nAll John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his sisters’ proud indifference,\nall his mother’s aversion, all the servants’ partiality, turned up in my\ndisturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.\_ Why was I always\nsuffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?\_ Why\ncould I never please?\_ Why was it useless to try to win any one’s\nfavour?\_ Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.\_\nGeorgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and\ninsolent carriage, was universally indulged.\_ Her beauty, her pink\ncheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at\nher, and to purchase indemnity for every fault.\_ John no one thwarted,\nmuch less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed\nthe little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse\nvines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the\nconservatory: he called his mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled\nher for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her\nwishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was\nstill “her own darling.”\_ I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil\nevery duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking,\nfrom morning to noon, and from noon to night.\n\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no\none had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned\nagainst him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with\ngeneral opprobrium.\n\n“Unjust!—unjust!” said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into\nprecocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,\ninstigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable\noppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never\neating or drinking more, and letting myself die.\n\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!\_ How all my\nbrain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!\_ Yet in what\ndarkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!\_ I could\nnot answer the ceaseless inward question—why I thus suffered; now,\nat the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.\n\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had\nnothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen\nvassalage.\_ If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love\nthem.\_ They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could\nnot sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to\nthem in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing,\nincapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a\nnoxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment,\nof contempt of their judgment.\_ I know that had I been a sanguine,\nbrilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally\ndependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more\ncomplacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the\ncordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to\nmake me the scapegoat of the nursery.\n\nDaylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o’clock, and\nthe beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.\_ I heard the rain\nstill beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling\nin the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and\nthen my courage sank.\_ My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt,\nforlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.\_ All\nsaid I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been\nbut just conceiving of starving myself to death?\_ That certainly was a\ncrime: and was I fit to die?\_ Or was the vault under the chancel of\nGateshead Church an inviting bourne?\_ In such vault I had been told did\nMr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt\non it with gathering dread.\_ I could not remember him; but I knew that\nhe was my own uncle—my mother’s brother—that he had taken me when a\nparentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had\nrequired a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as\none of her own children.\_ Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept\nthis promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would\npermit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race,\nand unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie?\_ It\nmust have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge\nto stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love,\nand to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family\ngroup.\n\nA singular notion dawned upon me.\_ I doubted not—never doubted—that if\nMr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I\nsat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also\nturning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror—I began to\nrecall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the\nviolation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the\nperjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit,\nharassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its\nabode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the\ndeparted—and rise before me in this chamber.\_ I wiped my tears and\nhushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a\npreternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed\nface, bending over me with strange pity.\_ This idea, consolatory in\ntheory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I\nendeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm.\_ Shaking my hair from\nmy eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;\nat this moment a light gleamed on the wall.\_ Was it, I asked myself, a\nray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?\_ No; moonlight\nwas still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling\nand quivered over my head.\_ I can now conjecture readily that this\nstreak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried\nby some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for\nhorror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift\ndarting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world.\_ My\nheart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I\ndeemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed,\nsuffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the\nlock in desperate effort.\_ Steps came running along the outer passage;\nthe key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.\n\n“Miss Eyre, are you ill?” said Bessie.\n\n“What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!” exclaimed Abbot.\n\n“Take me out!\_ Let me go into the nursery!” was my cry.\n\n“What for?\_ Are you hurt?\_ Have you seen something?” again demanded\nBessie.\n\n“Oh!\_ I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.”\_ I had now got\nhold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\n\n“She has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot, in some disgust.\_\n“And what a scream!\_ If she had been in great pain one would have\nexcused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty\ntricks.”\n\n“What is all this?” demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed\ncame along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling\nstormily.\_ “Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre\nshould be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.”\n\n“Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma’am,” pleaded Bessie.\n\n“Let her go,” was the only answer.\_ “Loose Bessie’s hand, child: you\ncannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.\_ I abhor\nartifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that\ntricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is\nonly on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall\nliberate you then.”\n\n“O aunt! have pity!\_ Forgive me!\_ I cannot endure it—let me be punished\nsome other way!\_ I shall be killed if—”\n\n“Silence!\_ This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she\nfelt it.\_ I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked\non me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous\nduplicity.\n\nBessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now\nfrantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in,\nwithout farther parley.\_ I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she\nwas gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the\nscene.\n"
