title: "\nCHAPTER XXXVIII—CONCLUSION\n\n\nReader, I married him.\_ A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and\nclerk, were alone present.\_ When we got back from church, I went into\nthe kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and\nJohn cleaning the knives, and I said—\n\n“Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.”\_ The\nhousekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of\npeople, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable\npiece of news without incurring the danger of having one’s ears pierced\nby some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of\nwordy wonderment.\_ Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle\nwith which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did\nfor some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of\ntime John’s knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary,\nbending again over the roast, said only—\n\n“Have you, Miss?\_ Well, for sure!”\n\nA short time after she pursued—“I seed you go out with the master, but I\ndidn’t know you were gone to church to be wed;” and she basted away.\_\nJohn, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.\n\n“I telled Mary how it would be,” he said: “I knew what Mr. Edward” (John\nwas an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of\nthe house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)—“I knew what\nMr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither:\nand he’s done right, for aught I know.\_ I wish you joy, Miss!” and he\npolitely pulled his forelock.\n\n“Thank you, John.\_ Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.”\_ I\nput into his hand a five-pound note.\_ Without waiting to hear more, I\nleft the kitchen.\_ In passing the door of that sanctum some time after,\nI caught the words—\n\n“She’ll happen do better for him nor ony o’t’ grand ladies.”\_ And again,\n“If she ben’t one o’ th’ handsomest, she’s noan faâl and varry\ngood-natured; and i’ his een she’s fair beautiful, onybody may see\nthat.”\n\nI wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had\ndone: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.\_ Diana and Mary\napproved the step unreservedly.\_ Diana announced that she would just\ngive me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see\nme.\n\n“She had better not wait till then, Jane,” said Mr. Rochester, when I\nread her letter to him; “if she does, she will be too late, for our\nhoneymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your\ngrave or mine.”\n\nHow St. John received the news, I don’t know: he never answered the\nletter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,\nwithout, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester’s name or alluding to my\nmarriage.\_ His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.\_ He\nhas maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever\nsince: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live\nwithout God in the world, and only mind earthly things.\n\nYou have not quite forgotten little Adèle, have you, reader?\_ I had not;\nI soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at\nthe school where he had placed her.\_ Her frantic joy at beholding me\nagain moved me much.\_ She looked pale and thin: she said she was not\nhappy.\_ I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its\ncourse of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with\nme.\_ I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this\nimpracticable; my time and cares were now required by another—my husband\nneeded them all.\_ So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent\nsystem, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing\nher home sometimes.\_ I took care she should never want for anything that\ncould contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,\nbecame very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.\_ As she\ngrew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her\nFrench defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and\nobliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.\_ By her\ngrateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any\nlittle kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.\n\nMy tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married\nlife, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have\nmost frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.\n\nI have now been married ten years.\_ I know what it is to live entirely\nfor and with what I love best on earth.\_ I hold myself supremely\nblest—blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband’s\nlife as fully as he is mine.\_ No woman was ever nearer to her mate than\nI am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.\_ I\nknow no weariness of my Edward’s society: he knows none of mine, any\nmore than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our\nseparate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.\_ To be together is\nfor us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.\_ We\ntalk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more\nanimated and an audible thinking.\_ All my confidence is bestowed on him,\nall his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in\ncharacter—perfect concord is the result.\n\nMr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps\nit was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very\nclose: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.\_\nLiterally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.\_ He saw\nnature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his\nbehalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town,\nriver, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round\nus—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp\non his eye.\_ Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of\nconducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to\nbe done.\_ And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most\nexquisite, even though sad—because he claimed these services without\npainful shame or damping humiliation.\_ He loved me so truly, that he\nknew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so\nfondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.\n\nOne morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to\nhis dictation, he came and bent over me, and said—“Jane, have you a\nglittering ornament round your neck?”\n\nI had a gold watch-chain: I answered “Yes.”\n\n“And have you a pale blue dress on?”\n\n\n\nI had.\_ He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the\nobscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was\nsure of it.\n\nHe and I went up to London.\_ He had the advice of an eminent oculist;\nand he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.\_ He cannot now\nsee very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his\nway without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to\nhim—the earth no longer a void.\_ When his first-born was put into his\narms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once\nwere—large, brilliant, and black.\_ On that occasion, he again, with a\nfull heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.\n\nMy Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most\nlove are happy likewise.\_ Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:\nalternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see\nthem.\_ Diana’s husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a\ngood man.\_ Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother’s,\nand, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.\_\nBoth Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved\nby them.\n\nAs to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.\_ He entered on\nthe path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.\_ A more\nresolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.\_\nFirm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he\nlabours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he\nhews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber\nit.\_ He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but\nhis is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim\nconvoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.\_ His is the exaction of the\napostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come\nafter me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.”\_\nHis is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a\nplace in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth—who\nstand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty\nvictories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.\n\nSt. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.\_ Himself has hitherto\nsufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious\nsun hastens to its setting.\_ The last letter I received from him drew\nfrom my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he\nanticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.\_ I know that a\nstranger’s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful\nservant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord.\_ And why\nweep for this?\_ No fear of death will darken St. John’s last hour: his\nmind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be\nsure, his faith steadfast.\_ His own words are a pledge of this—\n\n“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned me.\_ Daily He announces more\ndistinctly,—‘Surely I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly\nrespond,—‘Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!’”\n"
