<p>Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and
seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I
asked, “What am I to do?”</p>

<p>But the answer my mind gave—“Leave Thornfield at once”—was so prompt, so
dread, that I stopped my ears.&#160; I said I could not bear such words now.&#160;
“That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my woe,” I
alleged: “that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found
them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but that I
must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.&#160; I cannot
do it.”</p>

<p>But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold
that I should do it.&#160; I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be
weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw
laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the
throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in
the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her
down to unsounded depths of agony.</p>

<p>“Let me be torn away,” then I cried.&#160; “Let another help me!”</p>

<p>“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:
your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.”</p>

<p>I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
judge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled.&#160; My head
swam as I stood erect.&#160; I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
had taken no breakfast.&#160; And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had tapped at
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.&#160; “Friends always forget
those whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and
passed out.&#160; I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my
sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble.&#160; I could not soon recover
myself.&#160; I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught
me.&#160; I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair
across my chamber threshold.</p>

<p>“You come out at last,” he said.&#160; “Well, I have been waiting for you
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:
five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the
lock like a burglar.&#160; So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve
alone!&#160; I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.&#160;
You are passionate.&#160; I expected a scene of some kind.&#160; I was prepared
for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast:
now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.&#160;
But I err: you have not wept at all!&#160; I see a white cheek and a faded
eye, but no trace of tears.&#160; I suppose, then, your heart has been
weeping blood?”</p>

<p>“Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?&#160; Nothing bitter—nothing poignant?&#160;
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?&#160; You sit quietly where I
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.”</p>

<p>“Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.&#160; If the man who had but one
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his
bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody
blunder more than I now rue mine.&#160; Will you ever forgive me?”</p>

<p>Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.&#160; There was such
deep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy
in his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole
look and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only
at my heart’s core.</p>

<p>“You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?” ere long he inquired
wistfully—wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
the result rather of weakness than of will.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me so roundly and sharply—don’t spare me.”</p>

<p>“I cannot: I am tired and sick.&#160; I want some water.”&#160; He heaved a sort
of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.&#160;
At first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to
my glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for,
summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.&#160; He put wine to
my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me,
and was soon myself.&#160; I was in the library—sitting in his chair—he was
quite near.&#160; “If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang,
it would be well for me,” I thought; “then I should not have to make the
effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr.
Rochester’s.&#160; I must leave him, it appears.&#160; I do not want to leave
him—I cannot leave him.”</p>

<p>“How are you now, Jane?”</p>

<p>“Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.”</p>

<p>“Taste the wine again, Jane.”</p>

<p>I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
looked at me attentively.&#160; Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.&#160; I turned my face away and
put his aside.</p>

<p>“What!—How is this?” he exclaimed hastily.&#160; “Oh, I know! you won’t kiss
the husband of Bertha Mason?&#160; You consider my arms filled and my
embraces appropriated?”</p>

<p>“At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jane?&#160; I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
for you—Because I have a wife already, you would reply.—I guess
rightly?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
me as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been simulating
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.&#160; What do you say to
that?&#160; I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint
still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place,
you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides,
the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you
spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a
scene: you are thinking how <em>to act</em>—<em>talking</em> you consider is of no
use.&#160; I know you—I am on my guard.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and my unsteady voice
warned me to curtail my sentence.</p>

<p>“Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
me.&#160; You have as good as said that I am a married man—as a married man
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
me.&#160; You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live
under this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if ever I say a friendly word
to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
say,—‘That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
to him;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.”</p>

<p>I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: “All is changed about me, sir;
I must change too—there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
there is only one way—Adèle must have a new governess, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Adèle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I mean
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
Thornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
sky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
of such as we imagine.&#160; Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.&#160; I
was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it
was haunted.&#160; I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you,
all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adèle
never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she
was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
elsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.&#160;
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
assassination, even of what I most hate.</p>

<p>“Concealing the mad-woman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
upas-tree: that demon’s vicinage is poisoned, and always was.&#160; But I’ll
shut up Thornfield Hall: I’ll nail up the front door and board the lower
windows: I’ll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with <em>my
wife</em>, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when <em>my wife</em>
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on—”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
you speak of her with hate—with vindictive antipathy.&#160; It is cruel—she
cannot help being mad.”</p>

<p>“Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don’t
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not
because she is mad I hate her.&#160; If you were mad, do you think I should
hate you?”</p>

<p>“I do indeed, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
the sort of love of which I am capable.&#160; Every atom of your flesh is as
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.&#160; Your
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
waistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive
you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.&#160; I
should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet
moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang
over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in
return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no
longer a ray of recognition for me.—But why do I follow that train of
ideas?&#160; I was talking of removing you from Thornfield.&#160; All, you know,
is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.&#160; I only ask
you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell
to its miseries and terrors for ever!&#160; I have a place to repair to,
which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from
unwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.”</p>

<p>“And take Adèle with you, sir,” I interrupted; “she will be a companion
for you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Jane?&#160; I told you I would send Adèle to school; and
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,—a
French dancer’s bastard?&#160; Why do you importune me about her!&#160; I say, why
do you assign Adèle to me for a companion?”</p>

<p>“You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
too dull for you.”</p>

<p>“Solitude! solitude!” he reiterated with irritation.&#160; “I see I must come
to an explanation.&#160; I don’t know what sphynx-like expression is forming
in your countenance.&#160; You are to share my solitude.&#160; Do you understand?”</p>

<p>I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.&#160; He had been walking
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.&#160;
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.</p>

<p>“Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” he said at last, speaking more
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.&#160; “The reel of
silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come
a knot and a puzzle: here it is.&#160; Now for vexation, and exasperation,
and endless trouble!&#160; By God!&#160; I long to exert a fraction of Samson’s
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!”</p>

<p>He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
before me.</p>

<p>“Jane! will you hear reason?” (he stooped and approached his lips to my
ear); “because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.”&#160; His voice was hoarse;
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
and plunge headlong into wild license.&#160; I saw that in another moment,
and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with
him.&#160; The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which to
control and restrain him—a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
have sealed my doom,—and his.&#160; But I was not afraid: not in the least.&#160;
I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.&#160; The
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.&#160; I took hold
of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
soothingly—</p>

<p>“Sit down; I’ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have
to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”</p>

<p>He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.&#160; I had been
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.&#160; Now, however, I
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they
liked.&#160; If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.&#160; So I gave way and
cried heartily.</p>

<p>Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.&#160; I said I could
not while he was in such a passion.</p>

<p>“But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
endure it.&#160; Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.”</p>

<p>His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
became calm.&#160; Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
I would not permit it.&#160; Then he would draw me to him: no.</p>

<p>“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
along every nerve I had; “you don’t love me, then?&#160; It was only my
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?&#160; Now that you think
me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
were some toad or ape.”</p>

<p>These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?&#160; I ought probably to
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse
at thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
where I had wounded.</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> love you,” I said, “more than ever: but I must not show or
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.”</p>

<p>“The last time, Jane!&#160; What! do you think you can live with me, and see
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is
but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mention it!&#160; If I storm, you have the art of weeping.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.”</p>

<p>“For how long, Jane?&#160; For a few minutes, while you smooth your
hair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face—which looks
feverish?”</p>

<p>“I must leave Adèle and Thornfield.&#160; I must part with you for my whole
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
scenes.”</p>

<p>“Of course: I told you you should.&#160; I pass over the madness about
parting from me.&#160; You mean you must become a part of me.&#160; As to the new
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.&#160;
You shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally.&#160; I shall keep
only to you so long as you and I live.&#160; You shall go to a place I have
in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
Mediterranean.&#160; There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
innocent life.&#160; Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make
you my mistress.&#160; Why did you shake your head?&#160; Jane, you must be
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.”</p>

<p>His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
still I dared to speak.</p>

<p>“Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
yourself.&#160; If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.”</p>

<p>“Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that: I am not
long-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.&#160; Out of pity to me and
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware!”</p>

<p>He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.&#160;
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel:
to yield was out of the question.&#160; I did what human beings do
instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to
one higher than man: the words “God help me!” burst involuntarily from
my lips.</p>

<p>“I am a fool!” cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.&#160; “I keep telling her I am
not married, and do not explain to her why.&#160; I forget she knows nothing
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
infernal union with her.&#160; Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
opinion, when she knows all that I know!&#160; Just put your hand in mine,
Janet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
you are near me—and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
case.&#160; Can you listen to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; for hours if you will.”</p>

<p>“I ask only minutes.&#160; Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?”</p>

<p>“I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.”</p>

<p>“And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?”</p>

<p>“I have understood something to that effect.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.&#160;
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.&#160; I
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.&#160; He sought me a partner
betimes.&#160; Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
acquaintance.&#160; He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he
made inquiries.&#160; Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he
learned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of
thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed.&#160; When I left college, I was sent
out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.&#160; My father
said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.&#160; I found her a fine
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.&#160; Her
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did
she.&#160; They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.&#160; I seldom
saw her alone, and had very little private conversation with her.&#160; She
flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
accomplishments.&#160; All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and
envy me.&#160; I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.&#160; There is no
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
commission.&#160; Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.&#160;
Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!—an agony of
inward contempt masters me.&#160; I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
even know her.&#160; I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
refinement in her mind or manners—and, I married her:—gross, grovelling,
mole-eyed blockhead that I was!&#160; With less sin I might have—But let me
remember to whom I am speaking.”</p>

<p>“My bride’s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.&#160; The
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
lunatic asylum.&#160; There was a younger brother, too—a complete dumb
idiot.&#160; The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,
whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection
in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his
wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me),
will probably be in the same state one day.&#160; My father and my brother
Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand
pounds, and joined in the plot against me.”</p>

<p>“These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I found
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the
day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile—when I
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
exacting orders—even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.</p>

<p>“Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
shall express what I have to say.&#160; I lived with that woman upstairs four
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I
would not use cruelty.&#160; What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
propensities!&#160; How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed
on me!&#160; Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged
me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.</p>

<p>“My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years
my father died too.&#160; I was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous
indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was
associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of
me.&#160; And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the
doctors now discovered that <em>my wife</em> was mad—her excesses had
prematurely developed the germs of insanity.&#160; Jane, you don’t like my
narrative; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you.”</p>

<p>“Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of
tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those
who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish
hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed
with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them.&#160; But that is not
your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full
at this moment—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with
which your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine.&#160;
Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is
the very natal pang of the divine passion.&#160; I accept it, Jane; let the
daughter have free advent—my arms wait to receive her.”</p>

<p>“Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?”</p>

<p>“Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
all that intervened between me and the gulf.&#160; In the eyes of the world,
I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean
in my own sight—and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.&#160;
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her
and heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air
I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband—that
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to
live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.&#160;
Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.</p>

<p>“One night I had been awakened by her yells—(since the medical men had
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)—it was a fiery
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
hurricanes of those climates.&#160; Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up
and opened the window.&#160; The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no
refreshment anywhere.&#160; Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
like an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
tempest.&#160; I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and
my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out;
wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate,
with such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary
than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions
of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish
cries.</p>

<p>“‘This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell: this is the air—those are the
sounds of the bottomless pit!&#160; I have a right to deliver myself from it
if I can.&#160; The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.&#160; Of the fanatic’s burning eternity
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
one—let me break away, and go home to God!’</p>

<p>“I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which
contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.&#160; I only
entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the
crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish
and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.</p>

<p>“A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the
open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air
grew pure.&#160; I then framed and fixed a resolution.&#160; While I walked under
the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the
tropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for it
was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right
path to follow.</p>

<p>“The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed
leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart,
dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled
with living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a
pure draught.&#160; I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible.&#160; From a
flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer than
the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:—</p>

<p>“‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not known what
a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.&#160; You
may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance
and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you
will, and form what new tie you like.&#160; That woman, who has so abused
your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so
blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.&#160; See
that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all
that God and humanity require of you.&#160; Let her identity, her connection
with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no
living being.&#160; Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation
with secrecy, and leave her.’</p>

<p>“I acted precisely on this suggestion.&#160; My father and brother had not
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun to
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make
him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.&#160; Far from desiring to
publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.</p>

<p>“To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
monster in the vessel.&#160; Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den—a
goblin’s cell.&#160; I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as
it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be
placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she
had lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with
abuse of me.&#160; At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.&#160; She
and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night he was
stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my
confidence.&#160; Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she
could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts.&#160; Grace has, on the
whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own,
of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her
harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and
baffled.&#160; The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never
failed to take advantage of her guardian’s temporary lapses; once to
secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to
possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the
night-time.&#160; On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the
attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit
to you.&#160; I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then spent
her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague
reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have happened, I
cannot endure to reflect.&#160; When I think of the thing which flew at my
throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest
of my dove, my blood curdles—”</p>

<p>“And what, sir,” I asked, while he paused, “did you do when you had
settled her here?&#160; Where did you go?”</p>

<p>“What did I do, Jane?&#160; I transformed myself into a will-o’-the-wisp.&#160;
Where did I go?&#160; I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
March-spirit.&#160; I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
lands.&#160; My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield—”</p>

<p>“But you could not marry, sir.”</p>

<p>“I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.&#160; It was not
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.&#160; I meant to
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to
me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and
be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
burdened.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.&#160; You open
your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless
movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and
you wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart.&#160; But before I go on, tell
me what you mean by your ‘Well, sir?’&#160; It is a small phrase very
frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through
interminable talk: I don’t very well know why.”</p>

<p>“I mean,—What next?&#160; How did you proceed?&#160; What came of such an event?”</p>

<p>“Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?”</p>

<p>“Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry
you; and what she said.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of
Fate.&#160; For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital,
then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris;
occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence.&#160; Provided with plenty of
money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no
circles were closed against me.&#160; I sought my ideal of a woman amongst
English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German
gräfinnen.&#160; I could not find her.&#160; Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I
thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced
the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeserved.&#160; You are
not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person.&#160; I
longed only for what suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole: and I
longed vainly.&#160; Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever
so free, I—warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of
incongruous unions—would have asked to marry me.&#160; Disappointment made me
reckless.&#160; I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and
hate.&#160; That was my Indian Messalina’s attribute: rooted disgust at it
and her restrained me much, even in pleasure.&#160; Any enjoyment that
bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I
eschewed it.</p>

<p>“Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of
mistresses.&#160; The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps
which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them.&#160; You already know
what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated.&#160; She had two
successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered
singularly handsome.&#160; What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?&#160;
Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.&#160;
Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not
one whit to my taste.&#160; I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set
her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.&#160; But,
Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion
of me just now.&#160; You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.&#160; Did it
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
mistress and then another?&#160; You talk of it as a mere matter of course.”</p>

<p>“It was with me; and I did not like it.&#160; It was a grovelling fashion of
existence: I should never like to return to it.&#160; Hiring a mistress is
the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and
always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
degrading.&#160; I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with
Céline, Giacinta, and Clara.”</p>

<p>I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
that had ever been instilled into me, as—under any pretext—with any
justification—through any temptation—to become the successor of these
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now
in his mind desecrated their memory.&#160; I did not give utterance to this
conviction: it was enough to feel it.&#160; I impressed it on my heart, that
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.</p>

<p>“Now, Jane, why don’t you say ‘Well, sir?’&#160; I have not done.&#160; You are
looking grave.&#160; You disapprove of me still, I see.&#160; But let me come to
the point.&#160; Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
back to England.</p>

<p>“On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.&#160;
Abhorred spot!&#160; I expected no peace—no pleasure there.&#160; On a stile in
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.&#160; I passed it as
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
arbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble
guise.&#160; I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.&#160; Childish and slender
creature!&#160; It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed
to bear me on its tiny wing.&#160; I was surly; but the thing would not go:
it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a
sort of authority.&#160; I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.</p>

<p>“When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap
and sense—stole into my frame.&#160; It was well I had learnt that this elf
must return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—or I could not
have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the
dim hedge, without singular regret.&#160; I heard you come home that night,
Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
watched for you.&#160; The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for
half-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery.&#160; It was a
snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors.&#160; I was in my
room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch.&#160; Adèle claimed
your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were
elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you
talked to her and amused her a long time.&#160; When at last she left you,
you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace
the gallery.&#160; Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at
the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you
paced gently on and dreamed.&#160; I think those day visions were not dark:
there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft
excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious,
hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of
youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and
on to an ideal heaven.&#160; The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant
in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at
yourself, Janet!&#160; There was much sense in your smile: it was very
shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction.&#160; It seemed to
say—‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are
absolutely unreal.&#160; I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my
brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract
to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’&#160; You ran
downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly
house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was.&#160; I
was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.</p>

<p>“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
presence.&#160; An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.&#160; You entered
the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were
quaintly dressed—much as you are now.&#160; I made you talk: ere long I found
you full of strange contrasts.&#160; Your garb and manner were restricted by
rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined
by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of
making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or
blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing
eye to your interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in each
glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and
round answers.&#160; Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you
felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross
master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain
pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no
surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched
me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I
cannot describe.&#160; I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw:
I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.&#160; Yet, for a long time,
I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely.&#160; I was an
intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making
this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled
with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would
fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.&#160; I did not then know
that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of
one, cut in an indestructible gem.&#160; Moreover, I wished to see whether
you would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you kept in the
schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you,
you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was
consistent with respect.&#160; Your habitual expression in those days, Jane,
was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not
buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure.&#160; I wondered
what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to
find this out.</p>

<p>“I resumed my notice of you.&#160; There was something glad in your glance,
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
heart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that
made you mournful.&#160; I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful
happy accent.&#160; I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this
time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me
with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice
might be—whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the
friend and be benignant.&#160; I was now too fond of you often to simulate
the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom
and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado
often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me;
for I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.</p>

<p>“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
when the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”</p>

<p>I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.</p>

<p>“You see now how the case stands—do you not?” he continued.&#160; “After a
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have
found you.&#160; You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel.&#160; I am
bound to you with a strong attachment.&#160; I think you good, gifted,
lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans
to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence
about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in
one.</p>

<p>“It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.&#160; To
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
had but a hideous demon.&#160; I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.&#160; I feared early
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
confidences.&#160; This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your
nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly my
life of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and
worthier existence—shown to you, not my <em>resolution</em> (that word is
weak), but my resistless <em>bent</em> to love faithfully and well, where I am
faithfully and well loved in return.&#160; Then I should have asked you to
accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.&#160; Jane—give it me
now.”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“Why are you silent, Jane?”</p>

<p>I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.&#160;
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!&#160; Not a human
being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved;
and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce
love and idol.&#160; One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—“Depart!”</p>

<p>“Jane, you understand what I want of you?&#160; Just this promise—‘I will be
yours, Mr. Rochester.’”</p>

<p>“Mr. Rochester, I will <em>not</em> be yours.”</p>

<p>Another long silence.</p>

<p>“Jane!” recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still voice was
the pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
and to let me go another?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Jane” (bending towards and embracing me), “do you mean it now?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“And now?” softly kissing my forehead and cheek.</p>

<p>“I do,” extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jane, this is bitter!&#160; This—this is wicked.&#160; It would not be wicked
to love me.”</p>

<p>“It would to obey you.”</p>

<p>A wild look raised his brows—crossed his features: he rose; but he
forebore yet.&#160; I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
shook, I feared—but I resolved.</p>

<p>“One instant, Jane.&#160; Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
gone.&#160; All happiness will be torn away with you.&#160; What then is left?&#160;
For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to
some corpse in yonder churchyard.&#160; What shall I do, Jane?&#160; Where turn
for a companion and for some hope?”</p>

<p>“Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.&#160; Believe in heaven.&#160; Hope to
meet again there.”</p>

<p>“Then you will not yield?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?”&#160; His voice
rose.</p>

<p>“I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.”</p>

<p>“Then you snatch love and innocence from me?&#160; You fling me back on lust
for a passion—vice for an occupation?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
myself.&#160; We were born to strive and endure—you as well as I: do so.&#160; You
will forget me before I forget you.”</p>

<p>“You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.&#160; I declared I
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.&#160; And what
a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is
proved by your conduct!&#160; Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to
despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the
breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need
fear to offend by living with me?”</p>

<p>This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.&#160; They
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.&#160; “Oh,
comply!” it said.&#160; “Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at his
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
recklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell
him you love him and will be his.&#160; Who in the world cares for <em>you</em>?
or who will be injured by what you do?”</p>

<p>Still indomitable was the reply—“<em>I</em> care for myself.&#160; The more
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I
will respect myself.&#160; I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by
man.&#160; I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and
not mad—as I am now.&#160; Laws and principles are not for the times when
there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and
soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate
they shall be.&#160; If at my individual convenience I might break them, what
would be their worth?&#160; They have a worth—so I have always believed; and
if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with
my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
throbs.&#160; Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.”</p>

<p>I did.&#160; Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.&#160; His
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
waist.&#160; He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and
glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
certainty of ultimate safety.&#160; The soul, fortunately, has an
interpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in
the eye.&#160; My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
strength almost exhausted.</p>

<p>“Never,” said he, as he ground his teeth, “never was anything at once so
frail and so indomitable.&#160; A mere reed she feels in my hand!”&#160; (And he
shook me with the force of his hold.)&#160; “I could bend her with my finger
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I
crushed her?&#160; Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing
looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern
triumph.&#160; Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage,
beautiful creature!&#160; If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage
will only let the captive loose.&#160; Conqueror I might be of the house; but
the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor
of its clay dwelling-place.&#160; And it is you, spirit—with will and energy,
and virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame.&#160; Of
yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if
you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an
essence—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.&#160; Oh! come, Jane,
come!”</p>

<p>As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.&#160;
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
however, would have succumbed now.&#160; I had dared and baffled his fury; I
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.</p>

<p>“You are going, Jane?”</p>

<p>“I am going, sir.”</p>

<p>“You are leaving me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You will not come?&#160; You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?&#160; My deep
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?”</p>

<p>What unutterable pathos was in his voice!&#160; How hard it was to reiterate
firmly, “I am going.”</p>

<p>“Jane!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Rochester!”</p>

<p>“Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.&#160;
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
glance on my sufferings—think of me.”</p>

<p>He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.&#160; “Oh, Jane! my
hope—my love—my life!” broke in anguish from his lips.&#160; Then came a
deep, strong sob.</p>

<p>I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back as
determinedly as I had retreated.&#160; I knelt down by him; I turned his face
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
hand.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my dear master!” I said.&#160; “God keep you from harm and
wrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kindness to
me.”</p>

<p>“Little Jane’s love would have been my best reward,” he answered;
“without it, my heart is broken.&#160; But Jane will give me her love:
yes—nobly, generously.”</p>

<p>Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
once quitted the room.</p>

<p>“Farewell!” was the cry of my heart as I left him.&#160; Despair added,
“Farewell for ever!”</p>

<p>That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
I lay down in bed.&#160; I was transported in thought to the scenes of
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.&#160; The light that long
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed
glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of
the obscured ceiling.&#160; I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to
clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours
she is about to sever.&#160; I watched her come—watched with the strangest
anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her
disk.&#160; She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first
penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a
white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow
earthward.&#160; It gazed and gazed on me.&#160; It spoke to my spirit:
immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my
heart—</p>

<p>“My daughter, flee temptation.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I will.”</p>

<p>So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.&#160; It was yet
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.&#160; “It
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,” thought I.&#160;
I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.&#160; I knew
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.&#160; In seeking
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr.
Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago.&#160; I left that; it was
not mine: it was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air.&#160; The other
articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings
(it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet,
pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put
on yet, and stole from my room.</p>

<p>“Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” I whispered, as I glided past her door.&#160;
“Farewell, my darling Adèle!” I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.&#160;
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.&#160; I had to
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.</p>

<p>I would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was
forced to stop also.&#160; No sleep was there: the inmate was walking
restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I
listened.&#160; There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if
I chose: I had but to go in and to say—</p>

<p>“Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
death,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.&#160; I thought of
this.</p>

<p>That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
for day.&#160; He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.&#160; He
would have me sought for: vainly.&#160; He would feel himself forsaken; his
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.&#160; I thought of
this too.&#160; My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
on.</p>

<p>Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did
it mechanically.&#160; I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the
lock.&#160; I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to
walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.&#160;
All this I did without one sound.&#160; I opened the door, passed out, shut
it softly.&#160; Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.&#160; The great gates were closed
and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.&#160; Through that
I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.</p>

<p>A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the
contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often
noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.&#160; No
reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back;
not even one forward.&#160; Not one thought was to be given either to the
past or the future.&#160; The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly
sad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down
my energy.&#160; The last was an awful blank: something like the world when
the deluge was gone by.</p>

<p>I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.&#160; I believe
it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when
I left the house, were soon wet with dew.&#160; But I looked neither to
rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.&#160; He who is taken out
to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers
that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the
disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I
thought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I
thought of what I left.&#160; I could not help it.&#160; I thought of him now—in
his room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would
stay with him and be his.&#160; I longed to be his; I panted to return: it
was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.&#160;
As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered.&#160; I could go back and be
his comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.&#160;
Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how
it goaded me!&#160; It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when
I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther
in.&#160; Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to
their mates; birds were emblems of love.&#160; What was I?&#160; In the midst of
my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.&#160; I
had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect.&#160; I had
injured—wounded—left my master.&#160; I was hateful in my own eyes.&#160; Still I
could not turn, nor retrace one step.&#160; God must have led me on.&#160; As to
my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and
stifled the other.&#160; I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary
way: fast, fast I went like one delirious.&#160; A weakness, beginning
inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the
ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.&#160; I had some
fear—or hope—that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling
forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet—as
eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.</p>

<p>When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.&#160; I stood up and
lifted my hand; it stopped.&#160; I asked where it was going: the driver
named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
connections.&#160; I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said
thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to
make it do.&#160; He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the
vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.</p>

<p>Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!&#160; May your eyes never
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.&#160; May
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.</p>
