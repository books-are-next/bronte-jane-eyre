<h1 id="xx_preface">PREFACE</h1>


<p>A preface to the first edition of “Jane Eyre” being unnecessary, I gave
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
miscellaneous remark.</p>

<p>My thanks are due in three quarters.</p>

<p>To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale
with few pretensions.</p>

<p>To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
obscure aspirant.</p>

<p>To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
Author.</p>

<p>The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted
and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to
them, <em>i.e.</em>, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say
cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.</p>

<p>Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved
me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
therefore, to be overlooked.&#160; I mean the timorous or carping few who
doubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on
earth.&#160; I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
would remind them of certain simple truths.</p>

<p>Conventionality is not morality.&#160; Self-righteousness is not religion.&#160;
To attack the first is not to assail the last.&#160; To pluck the mask from
the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
Thorns.</p>

<p>These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct
as is vice from virtue.&#160; Men too often confound them: they should not be
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.&#160; There is—I repeat
it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
and clearly the line of separation between them.</p>

<p>The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
shrines.&#160; It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the
gilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.</p>

<p>Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.</p>

<p>There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring.&#160; Is the satirist of
“Vanity Fair” admired in high places?&#160; I cannot tell; but I think if
some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and
over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take
his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
Rimoth-Gilead.</p>

<p>Why have I alluded to this man?&#160; I have alluded to him, Reader, because
I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.&#160; They say he
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.&#160; He
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
carrion, but Thackeray never does.&#160; His wit is bright, his humour
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the
summer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.&#160; Finally,
I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the
tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of
“Jane Eyre.”</p>
