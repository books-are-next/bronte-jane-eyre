<p>Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early that
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.&#160; When he did come down, it was
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
and waiting to speak with him.</p>

<p>Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
requisition as a reception-room for callers.&#160; A fire was lit in an
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
the future schoolroom.&#160; I discerned in the course of the morning that
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
master: for my part, I liked it better.</p>

<p>Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami,
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax <em>de</em> Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
box in whose contents she had an interest.</p>

<p>“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau
pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.&#160; Monsieur a parlé
de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était pas
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle.&#160; J’ai dit qu’oui: car
c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the afternoon
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.&#160; At dark I
allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.&#160;
Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
shrubs on the lawn.&#160; I let down the curtain and went back to the
fireside.</p>

<p>In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
him in the drawing-room this evening,” said she: “he has been so much
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.”</p>

<p>“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country.&#160; You had
better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.&#160; Here is
a candle.”</p>

<p>“Is it necessary to change my frock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
is here.”</p>

<p>This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except
one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I
thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.</p>

<p>“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax.&#160; I had a single little pearl
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
and then we went downstairs.&#160; Unused as I was to strangers, it was
rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s
presence.&#160; I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept
in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose
curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.</p>

<p>Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt
near him.&#160; Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire
shone full on his face.&#160; I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
his black hair.&#160; I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no
mistake.&#160; His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though
neither tall nor graceful.</p>

<p>Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he
never lifted his head as we approached.</p>

<p>“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.&#160; He
bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.</p>

<p>“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he: and there was something in the
forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further
to express, “What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or
not?&#160; At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.”</p>

<p>I sat down quite disembarrassed.&#160; A reception of finished politeness
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.&#160; Besides, the eccentricity of
the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.</p>

<p>He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.&#160; Mrs.
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable,
and she began to talk.&#160; Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.</p>

<p>“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got.&#160; She
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
arrange the cups, spoons, &amp;c., with assiduous celerity.&#160; I and Adèle
went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.</p>

<p>“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle
might perhaps spill it.”</p>

<p>I did as requested.&#160; As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking
the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—</p>

<p>“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
votre petit coffre?”</p>

<p>“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly.&#160; “Did you expect a present,
Miss Eyre?&#160; Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with eyes
that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.</p>

<p>“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are
generally thought pleasant things.”</p>

<p>“Generally thought?&#160; But what do <em>you</em> think?”</p>

<p>“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an
answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it
not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to
its nature.”</p>

<p>“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a
‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.”</p>

<p>“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty!&#160; I have examined Adèle, and find
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the
meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.</p>

<p>“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle
was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful
books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières.&#160; We obeyed, as in
duty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered
to amuse herself with Pilot.</p>

<p>“You have been resident in my house three months?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you came from—?”</p>

<p>“From Lowood school, in ---shire.”</p>

<p>“Ah! a charitable concern.&#160; How long were you there?”</p>

<p>“Eight years.”</p>

<p>“Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.&#160; I thought half the time in
such a place would have done up any constitution!&#160; No wonder you have
rather the look of another world.&#160; I marvelled where you had got that
sort of face.&#160; When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.&#160; Who are your parents?”</p>

<p>“I have none.”</p>

<p>“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I thought not.&#160; And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
that stile?”</p>

<p>“For whom, sir?”</p>

<p>“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.&#160; Did
I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on
the causeway?”</p>

<p>I shook my head.&#160; “The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
ago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.&#160; “And not even in
Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.&#160; I
don’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on
their revels more.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
wondering what sort of talk this was.</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must have
some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”</p>

<p>“No; none that I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“And your home?”</p>

<p>“I have none.”</p>

<p>“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”</p>

<p>“I have no brothers or sisters.”</p>

<p>“Who recommended you to come here?”</p>

<p>“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, “and I
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.&#160; Miss Eyre
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher
to Adèle.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself to give her a character,” returned Mr.
Rochester: “eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.&#160; She
began by felling my horse.”</p>

<p>“Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.</p>

<p>“I have to thank her for this sprain.”</p>

<p>The widow looked bewildered.</p>

<p>“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen much society?”</p>

<p>“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
Thornfield.”</p>

<p>“Have you read much?”</p>

<p>“Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
very learned.”</p>

<p>“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
parson, is he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
would worship their director.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p>“You are very cool!&#160; No!&#160; What! a novice not worship her priest!&#160; That
sounds blasphemous.”</p>

<p>“I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.&#160; He is
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
economy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
hardly sew.”</p>

<p>“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
caught the drift of the dialogue.</p>

<p>“And was that the head and front of his offending?” demanded Mr.
Rochester.</p>

<p>“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with
long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his
own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to
go to bed.”</p>

<p>“What age were you when you went to Lowood?”</p>

<p>“About ten.”</p>

<p>“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”</p>

<p>I assented.</p>

<p>“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
been able to guess your age.&#160; It is a point difficult to fix where the
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.&#160; And
now what did you learn at Lowood?&#160; Can you play?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Of course: that is the established answer.&#160; Go into the library—I mean,
if you please.—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.”</p>

<p>I departed, obeying his directions.</p>

<p>“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes.&#160; “You play <em>a little</em>, I
see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than
some, but not well.”</p>

<p>I closed the piano and returned.&#160; Mr. Rochester continued—“Adèle showed
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.&#160; I don’t know
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” I interjected.</p>

<p>“Ah! that pricks pride.&#160; Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
for its contents being original; but don’t pass your word unless you are
certain: I can recognise patchwork.”</p>

<p>“Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.”</p>

<p>I brought the portfolio from the library.</p>

<p>“Approach the table,” said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.&#160; Adèle and
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.</p>

<p>“No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the drawings from my hand as I
finish with them; but don’t push your faces up to mine.”</p>

<p>He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.&#160; Three he laid
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.</p>

<p>“Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,” said he, “and look at
them with Adèle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume your seat, and answer my
questions.&#160; I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
hand yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And when did you find time to do them?&#160; They have taken much time, and
some thought.”</p>

<p>“I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
other occupation.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your copies?”</p>

<p>“Out of my head.”</p>

<p>“That head I see now on your shoulders?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Has it other furniture of the same kind within?”</p>

<p>“I should think it may have: I should hope—better.”</p>

<p>He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.</p>

<p>While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.&#160; The subjects
had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind.&#160; As I saw them with the spiritual
eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand
would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a
pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.</p>

<p>These pictures were in water-colours.&#160; The first represented clouds low
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
was no land.&#160; One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
distinctness as my pencil could impart.&#160; Sinking below the bird and
mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was
the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or
torn.</p>

<p>The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.&#160; Beyond and above
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as
I could combine.&#160; The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the
lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes
shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud
torn by storm or by electric travail.&#160; On the neck lay a pale reflection
like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds
from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.</p>

<p>The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried,
along the horizon.&#160; Throwing these into distance, rose, in the
foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and
resting against it.&#160; Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and
supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow
quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of
meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible.&#160; Above
the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its
character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,
gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.&#160; This pale crescent was “the
likeness of a kingly crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which shape
had none.”</p>

<p>“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?” asked Mr. Rochester
presently.</p>

<p>“I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.&#160; To paint them, in short,
was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.”</p>

<p>“That is not saying much.&#160; Your pleasures, by your own account, have
been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland
while you blent and arranged these strange tints.&#160; Did you sit at them
long each day?”</p>

<p>“I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at
them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.”</p>

<p>“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?”</p>

<p>“Far from it.&#160; I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
powerless to realise.”</p>

<p>“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
probably.&#160; You had not enough of the artist’s skill and science to give
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.&#160; As to
the thoughts, they are elfish.&#160; These eyes in the Evening Star you must
have seen in a dream.&#160; How could you make them look so clear, and yet
not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.&#160; And what
meaning is that in their solemn depth?&#160; And who taught you to paint
wind?&#160; There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.&#160; Where
did you see Latmos?&#160; For that is Latmos.&#160; There! put the drawings away!”</p>

<p>I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
watch, he said abruptly—</p>

<p>“It is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adèle sit up
so long?&#160; Take her to bed.”</p>

<p>Adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
much.</p>

<p>“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making a movement of the hand
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
to dismiss us.&#160; Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my
portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so
withdrew.</p>

<p>“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,” I
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.</p>

<p>“Well, is he?”</p>

<p>“I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.”</p>

<p>“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed
to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
temper, allowance should be made.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature;
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
make his spirits unequal.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“Family troubles, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“But he has no family.”</p>

<p>“Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives.&#160; He lost his elder
brother a few years since.”</p>

<p>“His <em>elder</em> brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.&#160; The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
the property; only about nine years.”</p>

<p>“Nine years is a tolerable time.&#160; Was he so very fond of his brother as
to be still inconsolable for his loss?”</p>

<p>“Why, no—perhaps not.&#160; I believe there were some misunderstandings
between them.&#160; Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.&#160; The old gentleman was
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.&#160; He did
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.&#160; Old Mr. Rochester
and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
not brook what he had to suffer in it.&#160; He is not very forgiving: he
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
kind of life.&#160; I don’t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old
place.”</p>

<p>“Why should he shun it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.”</p>

<p>The answer was evasive.&#160; I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit
information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials.&#160; She
averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was
chiefly from conjecture.&#160; It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to
drop the subject, which I did accordingly.</p>
