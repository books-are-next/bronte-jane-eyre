CHAPTER XIV
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; In the
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes
stayed to dine with him.&nbsp; When his sprain was well enough to admit of
horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these
visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.
During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence,
and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre
in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes
pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a
distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with
gentlemanlike affability.&nbsp; His changes of mood did not offend me,
because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb
and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away
early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed
me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not
accompany them.&nbsp; Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message
came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs.&nbsp; I brushed Adèle’s hair and
made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual
Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and
plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended,
Adèle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for,
owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.&nbsp; She was
gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered
the dining-room.&nbsp; She appeared to know it by instinct.
“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.
“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.&nbsp; “And mind,” he
continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”
Adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had already retired to a
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
lid.&nbsp; Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—
“Oh ciel!&nbsp; Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
contemplation.
“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.”&nbsp; He drew a chair near his
own.&nbsp; “I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for,
old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with
their lisp.&nbsp; It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
tête-à-tête with a brat.&nbsp; Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss
Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.&nbsp;
Confound these civilities!&nbsp; I continually forget them.&nbsp; Nor do I
particularly affect simple-minded old ladies.&nbsp; By-the-bye, I must have
mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to
one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
knitting-basket in hand.
“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.&nbsp; I have
forbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
performed.”
Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,
the waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations
and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester,
“put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.&nbsp; Miss Eyre, draw your chair still
a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have
no mind to do.”
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the
large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and
ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still,
save the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling
up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different
to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less
gloomy.&nbsp; There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether
with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.&nbsp; He was,
in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also
more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;
still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the
swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his
granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great,
dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their
depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least,
of that feeling.
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
fastened on his physiognomy.
“You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do you think me handsome?”
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow
slipped from my tongue before I was aware—“No, sir.”
“Ah!&nbsp; By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you
have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple,
as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on
the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my
face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or
makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round
rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.&nbsp; What do you mean
by it?”
“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I ought to have replied that
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
consequence, or something of that sort.”
“You ought to have replied no such thing.&nbsp; Beauty of little consequence,
indeed!&nbsp; And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
my ear!&nbsp; Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?&nbsp; I suppose I have
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?”
“Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no
pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”
“Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.&nbsp; Criticise me:
does my forehead not please you?”
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”
“Far from it, sir.&nbsp; You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
return whether you are a philanthropist?”
“There again!&nbsp; Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
children and old women (low be it spoken!).&nbsp; No, young lady, I am not a
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: “and, besides, I once had
a kind of rude tenderness of heart.&nbsp; When I was as old as you, I was a
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and
unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me
with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an
India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and
with one sentient point in the middle of the lump.&nbsp; Yes: does that leave
hope for me?”
“Hope of what, sir?”
“Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”
“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know what
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
capable of being re-transformed?
“You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
puzzle on.&nbsp; Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
to-night.”
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his
arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen
plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,
disproportionate almost to his length of limb.&nbsp; I am sure most people
would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious
pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of
complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a
reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to
atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at
him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind,
imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.
“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he
repeated, “and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier
were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none
of these can talk.&nbsp; Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the
mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will:
you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.&nbsp; I have almost
forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but
to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and
recall what pleases.&nbsp; It would please me now to draw you out—to learn
more of you—therefore speak.”
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
smile either.
“Speak,” he urged.
“What about, sir?”
“Whatever you like.&nbsp; I leave both the choice of subject and the manner
of treating it entirely to yourself.”
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to talk for the
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
himself to the wrong person,” I thought.
“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”
I was dumb still.&nbsp; He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed.&nbsp; Ah! it is consistent.&nbsp; I put my
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.&nbsp; Miss Eyre, I beg your
pardon.&nbsp; The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an
inferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority
as must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s
advance in experience.&nbsp; This is legitimate, et j’y tiens, as Adèle
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a
rusty nail.”
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
“I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?&nbsp; Ask me
questions, and I will do my best to answer them.”
“Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to
be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the
grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and
that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many
nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly
with one set of people in one house?”
“Do as you please, sir.”
“That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
evasive one.&nbsp; Reply clearly.”
“I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I
have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your
time and experience.”
“Humph!&nbsp; Promptly spoken.&nbsp; But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
of both advantages.&nbsp; Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
or hurt by the tone of command.&nbsp; Will you?”
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar—he seems to
forget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders.
“The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing
expression; “but speak too.”
“I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
their orders.”
“Paid subordinates!&nbsp; What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?&nbsp; Oh
yes, I had forgotten the salary!&nbsp; Well then, on that mercenary ground,
will you agree to let me hector a little?”
“No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
dependency, I agree heartily.”
“And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”
“I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
salary.”
“Humbug!&nbsp; Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
therefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which
you are intensely ignorant.&nbsp; However, I mentally shake hands with you
for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in
which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was
frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the
contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded
misapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour.&nbsp; Not
three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered
me as you have just done.&nbsp; But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are
cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours:
Nature did it.&nbsp; And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions:
for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have
intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.”
“And so may you,” I thought.&nbsp; My eye met his as the idea crossed my
mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been
spoken as well as imagined—
“Yes, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have plenty of faults of my own:
I know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you.&nbsp; God wot I
need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series
of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which
might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.&nbsp; I
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
good as you—wiser—almost as stainless.&nbsp; I envy you your peace of mind,
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.&nbsp; Little girl, a memory
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?”
“How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?”
“All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned
it to fetid puddle.&nbsp; I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal.&nbsp;
Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the
better kind, and you see I am not so.&nbsp; You would say you don’t see it;
at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware,
by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting
its language).&nbsp; Then take my word for it,—I am not a villain: you are
not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but,
owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural
bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty
dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life.&nbsp; Do
you wonder that I avow this to you?&nbsp; Know, that in the course of your
future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary
confidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find
out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but
to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you
listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind
of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it
is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.”
“How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?”
“I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
writing my thoughts in a diary.&nbsp; You would say, I should have been
superior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was
not.&nbsp; When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I
turned desperate; then I degenerated.&nbsp; Now, when any vicious simpleton
excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that
I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a
level.&nbsp; I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do!&nbsp; Dread remorse when you
are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.”
“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”
“It is not its cure.&nbsp; Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I
have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it,
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?&nbsp; Besides, since happiness is
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
will get it, cost what it may.”
“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”
“Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?&nbsp; And I
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
moor.”
“It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.”
“How do you know?—you never tried it.&nbsp; How very serious—how very solemn
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head”
(taking one from the mantelpiece).&nbsp; “You have no right to preach to me,
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
unacquainted with its mysteries.”
“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”
“And who talks of error now?&nbsp; I scarcely think the notion that flittered
across my brain was an error.&nbsp; I believe it was an inspiration rather
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that.&nbsp; Here
it comes again!&nbsp; It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put
on the robes of an angel of light.&nbsp; I think I must admit so fair a guest
when it asks entrance to my heart.”
“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”
“Once more, how do you know?&nbsp; By what instinct do you pretend to
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from
the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”
“I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
suggestion had returned upon you.&nbsp; I feel sure it will work you more
misery if you listen to it.”
“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy.&nbsp;
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!”
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his
own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest,
he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the pilgrim—a
disguised deity, as I verily believe.&nbsp; Already it has done me good: my
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.”
“To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: I cannot keep up
the conversation, because it has got out of my depth.&nbsp; Only one thing, I
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
you regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.&nbsp; It seems
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
which you might revert with pleasure.”
“Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
paving hell with energy.”
“Sir?”
“I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.&nbsp;
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
been.”
“And better?”
“And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.&nbsp; You seem to
doubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
and Persians, that both are right.”
“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.”
“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”
“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
is liable to abuse.”
“Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
abuse it.”
“You are human and fallible.”
“I am: so are you—what then?”
“The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the
divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”
“What power?”
“That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be
right.’”
“‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.”
“May it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,
sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my
penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the
uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a
conviction of ignorance.
“Where are you going?”
“To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime.”
“You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.”
“Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
certainly not afraid.”
“You are afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.”
“In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”
“If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
it for sense.&nbsp; Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; Don’t trouble yourself to
answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally
vicious.&nbsp; The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;
controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your
limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or
master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move
too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me,
as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks
and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer
now.&nbsp; I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through
the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is
there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.&nbsp; You are still bent
on going?”
“It has struck nine, sir.”
“Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet.&nbsp; My
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
favours observation.&nbsp; While talking to you, I have also occasionally
watched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).&nbsp;
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.&nbsp; ‘Il
faut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and she rushed
out of the room.&nbsp; She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process:
in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a
miniature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
rising of—But never mind that.&nbsp; However, my tenderest feelings are about
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
will be realised.”
Ere long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall.&nbsp; She
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.&nbsp; A dress of
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
and small white satin sandals.
“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes
souliers? et mes bas?&nbsp; Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”
And spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—
“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising, she
added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas, monsieur?”
“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my
English gold out of my British breeches’ pocket.&nbsp; I have been green,
too, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now
than once freshened me.&nbsp; My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me
that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be
rid of.&nbsp; Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it
was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half
a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just
now.&nbsp; I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of
expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.&nbsp; I’ll explain
all this some day.&nbsp; Good-night.”

      CHAPTER XIV
      For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; In the
      mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
      gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes
      stayed to dine with him.&nbsp; When his sprain was well enough to admit of
      horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these
      visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.
      During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence,
      and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre
      in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes
      pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a
      distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with
      gentlemanlike affability.&nbsp; His changes of mood did not offend me,
      because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb
      and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.
      One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
      order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away
      early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed
      me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not
      accompany them.&nbsp; Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message
      came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs.&nbsp; I brushed Adèle’s hair and
      made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual
      Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and
      plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended,
      Adèle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for,
      owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.&nbsp; She was
      gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered
      the dining-room.&nbsp; She appeared to know it by instinct.
      “Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.
      “Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
      daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the
      deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
      depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.&nbsp; “And mind,” he
      continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
      or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
      conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”
      Adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had already retired to a
      sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
      lid.&nbsp; Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
      envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—
      “Oh ciel!&nbsp; Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
      contemplation.
      “Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
      to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
      “Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.”&nbsp; He drew a chair near his
      own.&nbsp; “I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for,
      old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with
      their lisp.&nbsp; It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
      tête-à-tête with a brat.&nbsp; Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss
      Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.&nbsp;
      Confound these civilities!&nbsp; I continually forget them.&nbsp; Nor do I
      particularly affect simple-minded old ladies.&nbsp; By-the-bye, I must have
      mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to
      one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”
      He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
      knitting-basket in hand.
      “Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.&nbsp; I have
      forbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
      with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
      interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
      performed.”
      Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
      sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,
      the waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations
      and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
      “Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester,
      “put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
      liberty to attend to my own pleasure.&nbsp; Miss Eyre, draw your chair still
      a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
      without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have
      no mind to do.”
      I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
      the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
      seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
      We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
      lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the
      large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and
      ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still,
      save the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling
      up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
      Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different
      to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less
      gloomy.&nbsp; There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether
      with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.&nbsp; He was,
      in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also
      more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;
      still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the
      swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his
      granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great,
      dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their
      depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least,
      of that feeling.
      He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
      same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
      fastened on his physiognomy.
      “You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do you think me handsome?”
      I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
      something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow
      slipped from my tongue before I was aware—“No, sir.”
      “Ah!&nbsp; By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you
      have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple,
      as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on
      the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my
      face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or
      makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round
      rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.&nbsp; What do you mean
      by it?”
      “Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I ought to have replied that
      it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
      appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
      consequence, or something of that sort.”
      “You ought to have replied no such thing.&nbsp; Beauty of little consequence,
      indeed!&nbsp; And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
      stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
      my ear!&nbsp; Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?&nbsp; I suppose I have
      all my limbs and all my features like any other man?”
      “Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no
      pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”
      “Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.&nbsp; Criticise me:
      does my forehead not please you?”
      He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
      brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
      abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
      “Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”
      “Far from it, sir.&nbsp; You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
      return whether you are a philanthropist?”
      “There again!&nbsp; Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
      my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
      children and old women (low be it spoken!).&nbsp; No, young lady, I am not a
      general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the
      prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
      fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
      marked breadth to the upper part of his head: “and, besides, I once had
      a kind of rude tenderness of heart.&nbsp; When I was as old as you, I was a
      feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and
      unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me
      with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an
      India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and
      with one sentient point in the middle of the lump.&nbsp; Yes: does that leave
      hope for me?”
      “Hope of what, sir?”
      “Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”
      “Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know what
      answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
      capable of being re-transformed?
      “You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
      any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
      is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
      physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
      puzzle on.&nbsp; Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
      to-night.”
      With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his
      arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen
      plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,
      disproportionate almost to his length of limb.&nbsp; I am sure most people
      would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious
      pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of
      complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a
      reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to
      atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at
      him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind,
      imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.
      “I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he
      repeated, “and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier
      were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none
      of these can talk.&nbsp; Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the
      mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will:
      you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.&nbsp; I have almost
      forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but
      to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and
      recall what pleases.&nbsp; It would please me now to draw you out—to learn
      more of you—therefore speak.”
      Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
      smile either.
      “Speak,” he urged.
      “What about, sir?”
      “Whatever you like.&nbsp; I leave both the choice of subject and the manner
      of treating it entirely to yourself.”
      Accordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to talk for the
      mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
      himself to the wrong person,” I thought.
      “You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”
      I was dumb still.&nbsp; He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
      single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
      “Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed.&nbsp; Ah! it is consistent.&nbsp; I put my
      request in an absurd, almost insolent form.&nbsp; Miss Eyre, I beg your
      pardon.&nbsp; The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an
      inferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority
      as must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s
      advance in experience.&nbsp; This is legitimate, et j’y tiens, as Adèle
      would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
      I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
      my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a
      rusty nail.”
      He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
      insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
      “I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot
      introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?&nbsp; Ask me
      questions, and I will do my best to answer them.”
      “Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to
      be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the
      grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and
      that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many
      nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly
      with one set of people in one house?”
      “Do as you please, sir.”
      “That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
      evasive one.&nbsp; Reply clearly.”
      “I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
      are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I
      have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your
      time and experience.”
      “Humph!&nbsp; Promptly spoken.&nbsp; But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would
      never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
      of both advantages.&nbsp; Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
      must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
      or hurt by the tone of command.&nbsp; Will you?”
      I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar—he seems to
      forget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders.
      “The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing
      expression; “but speak too.”
      “I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
      inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
      their orders.”
      “Paid subordinates!&nbsp; What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?&nbsp; Oh
      yes, I had forgotten the salary!&nbsp; Well then, on that mercenary ground,
      will you agree to let me hector a little?”
      “No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
      and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
      dependency, I agree heartily.”
      “And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
      and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”
      “I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
      rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
      salary.”
      “Humbug!&nbsp; Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
      therefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which
      you are intensely ignorant.&nbsp; However, I mentally shake hands with you
      for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in
      which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was
      frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the
      contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded
      misapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour.&nbsp; Not
      three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered
      me as you have just done.&nbsp; But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are
      cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours:
      Nature did it.&nbsp; And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions:
      for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have
      intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.”
      “And so may you,” I thought.&nbsp; My eye met his as the idea crossed my
      mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been
      spoken as well as imagined—
      “Yes, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have plenty of faults of my own:
      I know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you.&nbsp; God wot I
      need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series
      of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which
      might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.&nbsp; I
      started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
      blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
      tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
      course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
      good as you—wiser—almost as stainless.&nbsp; I envy you your peace of mind,
      your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.&nbsp; Little girl, a memory
      without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an
      inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?”
      “How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?”
      “All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned
      it to fetid puddle.&nbsp; I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal.&nbsp;
      Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the
      better kind, and you see I am not so.&nbsp; You would say you don’t see it;
      at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware,
      by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting
      its language).&nbsp; Then take my word for it,—I am not a villain: you are
      not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but,
      owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural
      bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty
      dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life.&nbsp; Do
      you wonder that I avow this to you?&nbsp; Know, that in the course of your
      future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary
      confidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find
      out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but
      to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you
      listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind
      of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it
      is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.”
      “How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?”
      “I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
      writing my thoughts in a diary.&nbsp; You would say, I should have been
      superior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was
      not.&nbsp; When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I
      turned desperate; then I degenerated.&nbsp; Now, when any vicious simpleton
      excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that
      I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a
      level.&nbsp; I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do!&nbsp; Dread remorse when you
      are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.”
      “Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”
      “It is not its cure.&nbsp; Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I
      have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it,
      hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?&nbsp; Besides, since happiness is
      irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
      will get it, cost what it may.”
      “Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”
      “Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?&nbsp; And I
      may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
      moor.”
      “It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.”
      “How do you know?—you never tried it.&nbsp; How very serious—how very solemn
      you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head”
      (taking one from the mantelpiece).&nbsp; “You have no right to preach to me,
      you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
      unacquainted with its mysteries.”
      “I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
      remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”
      “And who talks of error now?&nbsp; I scarcely think the notion that flittered
      across my brain was an error.&nbsp; I believe it was an inspiration rather
      than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that.&nbsp; Here
      it comes again!&nbsp; It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put
      on the robes of an angel of light.&nbsp; I think I must admit so fair a guest
      when it asks entrance to my heart.”
      “Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”
      “Once more, how do you know?&nbsp; By what instinct do you pretend to
      distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from
      the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”
      “I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
      suggestion had returned upon you.&nbsp; I feel sure it will work you more
      misery if you listen to it.”
      “Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
      rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy.&nbsp;
      Here, come in, bonny wanderer!”
      He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his
      own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest,
      he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
      “Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the pilgrim—a
      disguised deity, as I verily believe.&nbsp; Already it has done me good: my
      heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.”
      “To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: I cannot keep up
      the conversation, because it has got out of my depth.&nbsp; Only one thing, I
      know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
      you regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you
      intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.&nbsp; It seems
      to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
      become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
      began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
      a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
      which you might revert with pleasure.”
      “Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
      paving hell with energy.”
      “Sir?”
      “I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.&nbsp;
      Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
      been.”
      “And better?”
      “And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.&nbsp; You seem to
      doubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
      are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
      and Persians, that both are right.”
      “They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.”
      “They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
      unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”
      “That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
      is liable to abuse.”
      “Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
      abuse it.”
      “You are human and fallible.”
      “I am: so are you—what then?”
      “The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the
      divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”
      “What power?”
      “That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be
      right.’”
      “‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.”
      “May it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
      continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,
      sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my
      penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the
      uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a
      conviction of ignorance.
      “Where are you going?”
      “To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime.”
      “You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.”
      “Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
      certainly not afraid.”
      “You are afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.”
      “In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”
      “If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
      it for sense.&nbsp; Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; Don’t trouble yourself to
      answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
      me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally
      vicious.&nbsp; The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;
      controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your
      limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or
      master, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move
      too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me,
      as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks
      and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer
      now.&nbsp; I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through
      the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is
      there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.&nbsp; You are still bent
      on going?”
      “It has struck nine, sir.”
      “Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet.&nbsp; My
      position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
      favours observation.&nbsp; While talking to you, I have also occasionally
      watched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
      study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).&nbsp;
      She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
      frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
      blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.&nbsp; ‘Il
      faut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and she rushed
      out of the room.&nbsp; She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process:
      in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a
      miniature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
      rising of—But never mind that.&nbsp; However, my tenderest feelings are about
      to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
      will be realised.”
      Ere long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall.&nbsp; She
      entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.&nbsp; A dress of
      rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
      gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
      rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
      and small white satin sandals.
      “Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes
      souliers? et mes bas?&nbsp; Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”
      And spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having
      reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
      then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—
      “Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising, she
      added, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas, monsieur?”
      “Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my
      English gold out of my British breeches’ pocket.&nbsp; I have been green,
      too, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now
      than once freshened me.&nbsp; My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me
      that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be
      rid of.&nbsp; Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it
      was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half
      a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just
      now.&nbsp; I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of
      expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.&nbsp; I’ll explain
      all this some day.&nbsp; Good-night.”

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="69">mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="66">gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="69">stayed to dine with him.&nbsp; When his sprain was well enough to admit of</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="65">horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="61">visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" id="idea9" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="72">and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="idea10" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="70">in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="70">because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="idea15" data-nb-words="9" data-nb-chars="55">and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="idea21" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="72">came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs.&nbsp; I brushed Adèle’s hair and</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="65">Adèle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for,</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="idea26" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="70">owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.&nbsp; She was</span>
            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="72">gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="69">deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the</span>

          <p><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="66">“Oh ciel!&nbsp; Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic</span>
