title: "\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThere was no possibility of taking a walk that day.\_ We had been\nwandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but\nsince dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the\ncold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so\npenetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.\n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\nafternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with\nnipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,\nthe nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority\nto Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama\nin the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and\nwith her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor\ncrying) looked perfectly happy.\_ Me, she had dispensed from joining the\ngroup; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at\na distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by\nher own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire\na more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and\nsprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it\nwere—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for\ncontented, happy, little children.”\n\n“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.\n\n“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is\nsomething truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that\nmanner.\_ Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain\nsilent.”\n\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.\_ It\ncontained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care\nthat it should be one stored with pictures.\_ I mounted into the\nwindow-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and,\nhaving drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in\ndouble retirement.\n\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left\nwere the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from\nthe drear November day.\_ At intervals, while turning over the leaves of\nmy book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.\_ Afar, it\noffered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and\nstorm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long\nand lamentable blast.\n\nI returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the letterpress\nthereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were\ncertain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite\nas a blank.\_ They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of\n“the solitary rocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of the\ncoast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the\nLindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—\n\n“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\n Boils round the naked, melancholy isles\n Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\n Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”\n\n\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of\nLapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with\n“the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary\nspace,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the\naccumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above\nheights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of\nextreme cold.”\_ Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own:\nshadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through\nchildren’s brains, but strangely impressive.\_ The words in these\nintroductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,\nand gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow\nand spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold\nand ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\n\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with\nits inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,\ngirdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the\nhour of eventide.\n\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine\nphantoms.\n\nThe fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over\nquickly: it was an object of terror.\n\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a\ndistant crowd surrounding a gallows.\n\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped\nunderstanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:\nas interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter\nevenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having\nbrought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit\nabout it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her\nnightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and\nadventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a\nlater period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of\nMoreland.\n\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.\_ I\nfeared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.\_ The\nbreakfast-room door opened.\n\n“Boh!\_ Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he\nfound the room apparently empty.\n\n“Where the dickens is she!” he continued.\_ “Lizzy!\_ Georgy! (calling to\nhis sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the\nrain—bad animal!”\n\n“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he\nmight not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it\nout himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza\njust put her head in at the door, and said at once—\n\n“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”\n\nAnd I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged\nforth by the said Jack.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked, with awkward diffidence.\n\n“Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the answer.\_ “I want you to\ncome here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a\ngesture that I was to approach and stand before him.\n\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than\nI, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and\nunwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and\nlarge extremities.\_ He gorged himself habitually at table, which made\nhim bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.\_ He\nought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a\nmonth or two, “on account of his delicate health.”\_ Mr. Miles, the\nmaster, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and\nsweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an\nopinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that\nJohn’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining\nafter home.\n\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy\nto me.\_ He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,\nnor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared\nhim, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.\_\nThere were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,\nbecause I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his\ninflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by\ntaking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the\nsubject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did\nboth now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind\nher back.\n\nHabitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three\nminutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without\ndamaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the\nblow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would\npresently deal it.\_ I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all\nat once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.\_ I tottered,\nand on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his\nchair.\n\n“That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said he,\n“and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look\nyou had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!”\n\nAccustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;\nmy care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the\ninsult.\n\n“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked.\n\n“I was reading.”\n\n“Show the book.”\n\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\n\n“You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;\nyou have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not\nto live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals\nwe do, and wear clothes at our mama’s expense.\_ Now, I’ll teach you to\nrummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to\nme, or will do in a few years.\_ Go and stand by the door, out of the way\nof the mirror and the windows.”\n\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him\nlift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively\nstarted aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume\nwas flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and\ncutting it.\_ The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its\nclimax; other feelings succeeded.\n\n“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said.\_ “You are like a murderer—you are like a\nslave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!”\n\nI had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of\nNero, Caligula, &c.\_ Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I\nnever thought thus to have declared aloud.\n\n“What! what!” he cried.\_ “Did she say that to me?\_ Did you hear her,\nEliza and Georgiana?\_ Won’t I tell mama? but first—”\n\nHe ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had\nclosed with a desperate thing.\_ I really saw in him a tyrant, a\nmurderer.\_ I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my\nneck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations\nfor the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic\nsort.\_ I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me\n“Rat!\_ Rat!” and bellowed out aloud.\_ Aid was near him: Eliza and\nGeorgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came\nupon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot.\_ We were parted:\nI heard the words—\n\n“Dear! dear!\_ What a fury to fly at Master John!”\n\n“Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!”\n\nThen Mrs. Reed subjoined—\n\n“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.”\_ Four hands were\nimmediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.\n"
