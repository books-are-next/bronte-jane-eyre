title: "\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nSome time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and\nseeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I\nasked, “What am I to do?”\n\nBut the answer my mind gave—“Leave Thornfield at once”—was so prompt, so\ndread, that I stopped my ears.\_ I said I could not bear such words now.\_\n“That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my woe,” I\nalleged: “that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found\nthem all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but that I\nmust leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.\_ I cannot\ndo it.”\n\nBut, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold\nthat I should do it.\_ I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be\nweak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw\nlaid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the\nthroat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in\nthe slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her\ndown to unsounded depths of agony.\n\n“Let me be torn away,” then I cried.\_ “Let another help me!”\n\n“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall\nyourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:\nyour heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.”\n\nI rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a\njudge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled.\_ My head\nswam as I stood erect.\_ I perceived that I was sickening from excitement\nand inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I\nhad taken no breakfast.\_ And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,\nlong as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I\nwas, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had tapped at\nthe door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.\_ “Friends always forget\nthose whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and\npassed out.\_ I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my\nsight was dim, and my limbs were feeble.\_ I could not soon recover\nmyself.\_ I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught\nme.\_ I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair\nacross my chamber threshold.\n\n“You come out at last,” he said.\_ “Well, I have been waiting for you\nlong, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:\nfive minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the\nlock like a burglar.\_ So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve\nalone!\_ I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.\_\nYou are passionate.\_ I expected a scene of some kind.\_ I was prepared\nfor the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast:\nnow a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.\_\nBut I err: you have not wept at all!\_ I see a white cheek and a faded\neye, but no trace of tears.\_ I suppose, then, your heart has been\nweeping blood?”\n\n“Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?\_ Nothing bitter—nothing poignant?\_\nNothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?\_ You sit quietly where I\nhave placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.”\n\n“Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.\_ If the man who had but one\nlittle ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his\nbread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake\nslaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody\nblunder more than I now rue mine.\_ Will you ever forgive me?”\n\nReader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.\_ There was such\ndeep remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy\nin his manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole\nlook and mien—I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only\nat my heart’s core.\n\n“You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?” ere long he inquired\nwistfully—wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,\nthe result rather of weakness than of will.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Then tell me so roundly and sharply—don’t spare me.”\n\n“I cannot: I am tired and sick.\_ I want some water.”\_ He heaved a sort\nof shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.\_\nAt first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to\nmy glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for,\nsummer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.\_ He put wine to\nmy lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me,\nand was soon myself.\_ I was in the library—sitting in his chair—he was\nquite near.\_ “If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang,\nit would be well for me,” I thought; “then I should not have to make the\neffort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr.\nRochester’s.\_ I must leave him, it appears.\_ I do not want to leave\nhim—I cannot leave him.”\n\n“How are you now, Jane?”\n\n“Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.”\n\n“Taste the wine again, Jane.”\n\nI obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and\nlooked at me attentively.\_ Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate\nexclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast\nthrough the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;\nbut I remembered caresses were now forbidden.\_ I turned my face away and\nput his aside.\n\n“What!—How is this?” he exclaimed hastily.\_ “Oh, I know! you won’t kiss\nthe husband of Bertha Mason?\_ You consider my arms filled and my\nembraces appropriated?”\n\n“At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.”\n\n“Why, Jane?\_ I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer\nfor you—Because I have a wife already, you would reply.—I guess\nrightly?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard\nme as a plotting profligate—a base and low rake who has been simulating\ndisinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,\nand strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.\_ What do you say to\nthat?\_ I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint\nstill, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place,\nyou cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides,\nthe flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you\nspoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a\nscene: you are thinking how to act—talking you consider is of no\nuse.\_ I know you—I am on my guard.”\n\n“Sir, I do not wish to act against you,” I said; and my unsteady voice\nwarned me to curtail my sentence.\n\n“Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy\nme.\_ You have as good as said that I am a married man—as a married man\nyou will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss\nme.\_ You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live\nunder this roof only as Adèle’s governess; if ever I say a friendly word\nto you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will\nsay,—‘That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock\nto him;’ and ice and rock you will accordingly become.”\n\nI cleared and steadied my voice to reply: “All is changed about me, sir;\nI must change too—there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations\nof feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,\nthere is only one way—Adèle must have a new governess, sir.”\n\n“Oh, Adèle will go to school—I have settled that already; nor do I mean\nto torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of\nThornfield Hall—this accursed place—this tent of Achan—this insolent\nvault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open\nsky—this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion\nof such as we imagine.\_ Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.\_ I\nwas wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it\nwas haunted.\_ I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you,\nall knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adèle\nnever would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she\nwas housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac\nelsewhere—though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more\nretired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely\nenough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in\nthe heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.\_\nProbably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to\neach villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect\nassassination, even of what I most hate.\n\n“Concealing the mad-woman’s neighbourhood from you, however, was\nsomething like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a\nupas-tree: that demon’s vicinage is poisoned, and always was.\_ But I’ll\nshut up Thornfield Hall: I’ll nail up the front door and board the lower\nwindows: I’ll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with my\nwife, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and\nshe shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her\ncompany and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when my wife\nis prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to\nstab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on—”\n\n“Sir,” I interrupted him, “you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:\nyou speak of her with hate—with vindictive antipathy.\_ It is cruel—she\ncannot help being mad.”\n\n“Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don’t\nknow what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not\nbecause she is mad I hate her.\_ If you were mad, do you think I should\nhate you?”\n\n“I do indeed, sir.”\n\n“Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about\nthe sort of love of which I am capable.\_ Every atom of your flesh is as\ndear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.\_ Your\nmind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure\nstill: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait\nwaistcoat—your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you\nflew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive\nyou in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.\_ I\nshould not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet\nmoments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang\nover you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in\nreturn; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no\nlonger a ray of recognition for me.—But why do I follow that train of\nideas?\_ I was talking of removing you from Thornfield.\_ All, you know,\nis prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.\_ I only ask\nyou to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell\nto its miseries and terrors for ever!\_ I have a place to repair to,\nwhich will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from\nunwelcome intrusion—even from falsehood and slander.”\n\n“And take Adèle with you, sir,” I interrupted; “she will be a companion\nfor you.”\n\n“What do you mean, Jane?\_ I told you I would send Adèle to school; and\nwhat do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,—a\nFrench dancer’s bastard?\_ Why do you importune me about her!\_ I say, why\ndo you assign Adèle to me for a companion?”\n\n“You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:\ntoo dull for you.”\n\n“Solitude! solitude!” he reiterated with irritation.\_ “I see I must come\nto an explanation.\_ I don’t know what sphynx-like expression is forming\nin your countenance.\_ You are to share my solitude.\_ Do you understand?”\n\nI shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was\nbecoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.\_ He had been walking\nfast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.\_\nHe looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on\nthe fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.\n\n“Now for the hitch in Jane’s character,” he said at last, speaking more\ncalmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.\_ “The reel of\nsilk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come\na knot and a puzzle: here it is.\_ Now for vexation, and exasperation,\nand endless trouble!\_ By God!\_ I long to exert a fraction of Samson’s\nstrength, and break the entanglement like tow!”\n\nHe recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just\nbefore me.\n\n“Jane! will you hear reason?” (he stooped and approached his lips to my\near); “because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.”\_ His voice was hoarse;\nhis look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond\nand plunge headlong into wild license.\_ I saw that in another moment,\nand with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with\nhim.\_ The present—the passing second of time—was all I had in which to\ncontrol and restrain him—a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would\nhave sealed my doom,—and his.\_ But I was not afraid: not in the least.\_\nI felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.\_ The\ncrisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,\nperhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.\_ I took hold\nof his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,\nsoothingly—\n\n“Sit down; I’ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have\nto say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”\n\nHe sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.\_ I had been\nstruggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress\nthem, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.\_ Now, however, I\nconsidered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they\nliked.\_ If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.\_ So I gave way and\ncried heartily.\n\nSoon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.\_ I said I could\nnot while he was in such a passion.\n\n“But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled\nyour little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not\nendure it.\_ Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.”\n\nHis softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,\nbecame calm.\_ Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but\nI would not permit it.\_ Then he would draw me to him: no.\n\n“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled\nalong every nerve I had; “you don’t love me, then?\_ It was only my\nstation, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?\_ Now that you think\nme disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I\nwere some toad or ape.”\n\nThese words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?\_ I ought probably to\nhave done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse\nat thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm\nwhere I had wounded.\n\n“I do love you,” I said, “more than ever: but I must not show or\nindulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.”\n\n“The last time, Jane!\_ What! do you think you can live with me, and see\nme daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?”\n\n“No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is\nbut one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.”\n\n“Oh, mention it!\_ If I storm, you have the art of weeping.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.”\n\n“For how long, Jane?\_ For a few minutes, while you smooth your\nhair—which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face—which looks\nfeverish?”\n\n“I must leave Adèle and Thornfield.\_ I must part with you for my whole\nlife: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange\nscenes.”\n\n“Of course: I told you you should.\_ I pass over the madness about\nparting from me.\_ You mean you must become a part of me.\_ As to the new\nexistence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.\_\nYou shall be Mrs. Rochester—both virtually and nominally.\_ I shall keep\nonly to you so long as you and I live.\_ You shall go to a place I have\nin the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the\nMediterranean.\_ There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most\ninnocent life.\_ Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make\nyou my mistress.\_ Why did you shake your head?\_ Jane, you must be\nreasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.”\n\nHis voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:\nstill I dared to speak.\n\n“Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by\nyourself.\_ If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your\nmistress: to say otherwise is sophistical—is false.”\n\n“Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man—you forget that: I am not\nlong-enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.\_ Out of pity to me and\nyourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and—beware!”\n\nHe bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his\ncheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.\_\nTo agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel:\nto yield was out of the question.\_ I did what human beings do\ninstinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to\none higher than man: the words “God help me!” burst involuntarily from\nmy lips.\n\n“I am a fool!” cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.\_ “I keep telling her I am\nnot married, and do not explain to her why.\_ I forget she knows nothing\nof the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my\ninfernal union with her.\_ Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in\nopinion, when she knows all that I know!\_ Just put your hand in mine,\nJanet—that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove\nyou are near me—and I will in a few words show you the real state of the\ncase.\_ Can you listen to me?”\n\n“Yes, sir; for hours if you will.”\n\n“I ask only minutes.\_ Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the\neldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?”\n\n“I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.”\n\n“And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?”\n\n“I have understood something to that effect.”\n\n“Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property\ntogether; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving\nme a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.\_\nYet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.\_ I\nmust be provided for by a wealthy marriage.\_ He sought me a partner\nbetimes.\_ Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old\nacquaintance.\_ He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he\nmade inquiries.\_ Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he\nlearned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of\nthirty thousand pounds: that sufficed.\_ When I left college, I was sent\nout to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.\_ My father\nsaid nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of\nSpanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.\_ I found her a fine\nwoman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.\_ Her\nfamily wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did\nshe.\_ They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.\_ I seldom\nsaw her alone, and had very little private conversation with her.\_ She\nflattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and\naccomplishments.\_ All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and\nenvy me.\_ I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being\nignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.\_ There is no\nfolly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,\nthe rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its\ncommission.\_ Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she\nallured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.\_\nOh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!—an agony of\ninward contempt masters me.\_ I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not\neven know her.\_ I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her\nnature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor\nrefinement in her mind or manners—and, I married her:—gross, grovelling,\nmole-eyed blockhead that I was!\_ With less sin I might have—But let me\nremember to whom I am speaking.”\n\n“My bride’s mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.\_ The\nhoneymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a\nlunatic asylum.\_ There was a younger brother, too—a complete dumb\nidiot.\_ The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate,\nwhilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection\nin his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his\nwretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me),\nwill probably be in the same state one day.\_ My father and my brother\nRowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand\npounds, and joined in the plot against me.”\n\n“These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of\nconcealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,\neven when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious\nto me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of\nbeing led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger—when I found\nthat I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the\nday with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained\nbetween us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from\nher a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile—when I\nperceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because\nno servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and\nunreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,\nexacting orders—even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I\ncurtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in\nsecret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.\n\n“Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words\nshall express what I have to say.\_ I lived with that woman upstairs four\nyears, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character\nripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast\nand rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I\nwould not use cruelty.\_ What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant\npropensities!\_ How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed\non me!\_ Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged\nme through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man\nbound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.\n\n“My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years\nmy father died too.\_ I was rich enough now—yet poor to hideous\nindigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was\nassociated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of\nme.\_ And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the\ndoctors now discovered that my wife was mad—her excesses had\nprematurely developed the germs of insanity.\_ Jane, you don’t like my\nnarrative; you look almost sick—shall I defer the rest to another day?”\n\n“No, sir, finish it now; I pity you—I do earnestly pity you.”\n\n“Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of\ntribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those\nwho offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish\nhearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed\nwith ignorant contempt for those who have endured them.\_ But that is not\nyour pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full\nat this moment—with which your eyes are now almost overflowing—with\nwhich your heart is heaving—with which your hand is trembling in mine.\_\nYour pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is\nthe very natal pang of the divine passion.\_ I accept it, Jane; let the\ndaughter have free advent—my arms wait to receive her.”\n\n“Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?”\n\n“Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was\nall that intervened between me and the gulf.\_ In the eyes of the world,\nI was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean\nin my own sight—and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her\ncrimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.\_\nStill, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her\nand heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air\nI breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband—that\nrecollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,\nI knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and\nbetter wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father\nhad lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to\nlive as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.\_\nThus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.\n\n“One night I had been awakened by her yells—(since the medical men had\npronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)—it was a fiery\nWest Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the\nhurricanes of those climates.\_ Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up\nand opened the window.\_ The air was like sulphur-steams—I could find no\nrefreshment anywhere.\_ Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly\nround the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull\nlike an earthquake—black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was\nsetting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball—she threw\nher last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of\ntempest.\_ I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and\nmy ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out;\nwherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate,\nwith such language!—no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary\nthan she: though two rooms off, I heard every word—the thin partitions\nof the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish\ncries.\n\n“‘This life,’ said I at last, ‘is hell: this is the air—those are the\nsounds of the bottomless pit!\_ I have a right to deliver myself from it\nif I can.\_ The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the\nheavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.\_ Of the fanatic’s burning eternity\nI have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present\none—let me break away, and go home to God!’\n\n“I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which\ncontained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.\_ I only\nentertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the\ncrisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish\nand design of self-destruction, was past in a second.\n\n“A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the\nopen casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air\ngrew pure.\_ I then framed and fixed a resolution.\_ While I walked under\nthe dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched\npomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the\ntropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen; for it\nwas true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right\npath to follow.\n\n“The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed\nleaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart,\ndried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled\nwith living blood—my being longed for renewal—my soul thirsted for a\npure draught.\_ I saw hope revive—and felt regeneration possible.\_ From a\nflowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea—bluer than\nthe sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:—\n\n“‘Go,’ said Hope, ‘and live again in Europe: there it is not known what\na sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.\_ You\nmay take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance\nand precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you\nwill, and form what new tie you like.\_ That woman, who has so abused\nyour long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so\nblighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.\_ See\nthat she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all\nthat God and humanity require of you.\_ Let her identity, her connection\nwith yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no\nliving being.\_ Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation\nwith secrecy, and leave her.’\n\n“I acted precisely on this suggestion.\_ My father and brother had not\nmade my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first\nletter I wrote to apprise them of the union—having already begun to\nexperience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family\ncharacter and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me—I\nadded an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous\nconduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make\nhim blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.\_ Far from desiring to\npublish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.\n\n“To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a\nmonster in the vessel.\_ Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,\nand saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret\ninner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast’s den—a\ngoblin’s cell.\_ I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as\nit was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be\nplaced; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she\nhad lucid intervals of days—sometimes weeks—which she filled up with\nabuse of me.\_ At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.\_ She\nand the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason’s wounds that night he was\nstabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my\nconfidence.\_ Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she\ncould have gained no precise knowledge as to facts.\_ Grace has, on the\nwhole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own,\nof which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her\nharassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and\nbaffled.\_ The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never\nfailed to take advantage of her guardian’s temporary lapses; once to\nsecrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to\npossess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the\nnight-time.\_ On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the\nattempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit\nto you.\_ I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then spent\nher fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague\nreminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have happened, I\ncannot endure to reflect.\_ When I think of the thing which flew at my\nthroat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest\nof my dove, my blood curdles—”\n\n“And what, sir,” I asked, while he paused, “did you do when you had\nsettled her here?\_ Where did you go?”\n\n“What did I do, Jane?\_ I transformed myself into a will-o’-the-wisp.\_\nWhere did I go?\_ I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the\nMarch-spirit.\_ I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its\nlands.\_ My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent\nwoman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield—”\n\n“But you could not marry, sir.”\n\n“I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.\_ It was not\nmy original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.\_ I meant to\ntell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to\nme so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and\nbe loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to\nunderstand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was\nburdened.”\n\n“Well, sir?”\n\n“When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.\_ You open\nyour eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless\nmovement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and\nyou wanted to read the tablet of one’s heart.\_ But before I go on, tell\nme what you mean by your ‘Well, sir?’\_ It is a small phrase very\nfrequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through\ninterminable talk: I don’t very well know why.”\n\n“I mean,—What next?\_ How did you proceed?\_ What came of such an event?”\n\n“Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?”\n\n“Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry\nyou; and what she said.”\n\n“I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her\nto marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of\nFate.\_ For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital,\nthen another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris;\noccasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence.\_ Provided with plenty of\nmoney and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no\ncircles were closed against me.\_ I sought my ideal of a woman amongst\nEnglish ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German\ngräfinnen.\_ I could not find her.\_ Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I\nthought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced\nthe realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeserved.\_ You are\nnot to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person.\_ I\nlonged only for what suited me—for the antipodes of the Creole: and I\nlonged vainly.\_ Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever\nso free, I—warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of\nincongruous unions—would have asked to marry me.\_ Disappointment made me\nreckless.\_ I tried dissipation—never debauchery: that I hated, and\nhate.\_ That was my Indian Messalina’s attribute: rooted disgust at it\nand her restrained me much, even in pleasure.\_ Any enjoyment that\nbordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I\neschewed it.\n\n“Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of\nmistresses.\_ The first I chose was Céline Varens—another of those steps\nwhich make a man spurn himself when he recalls them.\_ You already know\nwhat she was, and how my liaison with her terminated.\_ She had two\nsuccessors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered\nsingularly handsome.\_ What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?\_\nGiacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.\_\nClara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not\none whit to my taste.\_ I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set\nher up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.\_ But,\nJane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion\nof me just now.\_ You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don’t\nyou?”\n\n“I don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.\_ Did it\nnot seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one\nmistress and then another?\_ You talk of it as a mere matter of course.”\n\n“It was with me; and I did not like it.\_ It was a grovelling fashion of\nexistence: I should never like to return to it.\_ Hiring a mistress is\nthe next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and\nalways by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is\ndegrading.\_ I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with\nCéline, Giacinta, and Clara.”\n\nI felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain\ninference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching\nthat had ever been instilled into me, as—under any pretext—with any\njustification—through any temptation—to become the successor of these\npoor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now\nin his mind desecrated their memory.\_ I did not give utterance to this\nconviction: it was enough to feel it.\_ I impressed it on my heart, that\nit might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.\n\n“Now, Jane, why don’t you say ‘Well, sir?’\_ I have not done.\_ You are\nlooking grave.\_ You disapprove of me still, I see.\_ But let me come to\nthe point.\_ Last January, rid of all mistresses—in a harsh, bitter frame\nof mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life—corroded with\ndisappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against\nall womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,\nfaithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came\nback to England.\n\n“On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.\_\nAbhorred spot!\_ I expected no peace—no pleasure there.\_ On a stile in\nHay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.\_ I passed it as\nnegligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no\npresentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the\narbitress of my life—my genius for good or evil—waited there in humble\nguise.\_ I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour’s\naccident, it came up and gravely offered me help.\_ Childish and slender\ncreature!\_ It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed\nto bear me on its tiny wing.\_ I was surly; but the thing would not go:\nit stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a\nsort of authority.\_ I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.\n\n“When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new—a fresh sap\nand sense—stole into my frame.\_ It was well I had learnt that this elf\nmust return to me—that it belonged to my house down below—or I could not\nhave felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the\ndim hedge, without singular regret.\_ I heard you come home that night,\nJane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or\nwatched for you.\_ The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for\nhalf-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery.\_ It was a\nsnowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors.\_ I was in my\nroom; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch.\_ Adèle claimed\nyour outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were\nelsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you\ntalked to her and amused her a long time.\_ When at last she left you,\nyou lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace\nthe gallery.\_ Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at\nthe thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you\npaced gently on and dreamed.\_ I think those day visions were not dark:\nthere was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft\nexcitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious,\nhypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of\nyouth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and\non to an ideal heaven.\_ The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant\nin the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at\nyourself, Janet!\_ There was much sense in your smile: it was very\nshrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction.\_ It seemed to\nsay—‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are\nabsolutely unreal.\_ I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my\nbrain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract\nto travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’\_ You ran\ndownstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly\nhouse accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was.\_ I\nwas vexed with you for getting out of my sight.\n\n“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my\npresence.\_ An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was\nyours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.\_ You entered\nthe room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were\nquaintly dressed—much as you are now.\_ I made you talk: ere long I found\nyou full of strange contrasts.\_ Your garb and manner were restricted by\nrule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined\nby nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of\nmaking herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or\nblunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing\neye to your interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in each\nglance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and\nround answers.\_ Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you\nfelt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross\nmaster, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain\npleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no\nsurprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched\nme, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I\ncannot describe.\_ I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw:\nI liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.\_ Yet, for a long time,\nI treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely.\_ I was an\nintellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making\nthis novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled\nwith a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would\nfade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.\_ I did not then know\nthat it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of\none, cut in an indestructible gem.\_ Moreover, I wished to see whether\nyou would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you kept in the\nschoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you,\nyou passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was\nconsistent with respect.\_ Your habitual expression in those days, Jane,\nwas a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not\nbuoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure.\_ I wondered\nwhat you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to\nfind this out.\n\n“I resumed my notice of you.\_ There was something glad in your glance,\nand genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social\nheart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that\nmade you mournful.\_ I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;\nkindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your\ntones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful\nhappy accent.\_ I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this\ntime: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me\nwith a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice\nmight be—whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the\nfriend and be benignant.\_ I was now too fond of you often to simulate\nthe first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom\nand light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado\noften to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.”\n\n“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively\ndashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me;\nfor I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and\nthese revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.\n\n“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,\nwhen the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”\n\nI shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.\n\n“You see now how the case stands—do you not?” he continued.\_ “After a\nyouth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary\nsolitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have\nfound you.\_ You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel.\_ I am\nbound to you with a strong attachment.\_ I think you good, gifted,\nlovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans\nto you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence\nabout you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in\none.\n\n“It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.\_ To\ntell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I\nhad but a hideous demon.\_ I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I\nfeared a stubbornness that exists in your character.\_ I feared early\ninstilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding\nconfidences.\_ This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your\nnobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly my\nlife of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and\nworthier existence—shown to you, not my resolution (that word is\nweak), but my resistless bent to love faithfully and well, where I am\nfaithfully and well loved in return.\_ Then I should have asked you to\naccept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.\_ Jane—give it me\nnow.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“Why are you silent, Jane?”\n\nI was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.\_\nTerrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!\_ Not a human\nbeing that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved;\nand him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce\nlove and idol.\_ One drear word comprised my intolerable duty—“Depart!”\n\n“Jane, you understand what I want of you?\_ Just this promise—‘I will be\nyours, Mr. Rochester.’”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours.”\n\nAnother long silence.\n\n“Jane!” recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,\nand turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still voice was\nthe pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,\nand to let me go another?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Jane” (bending towards and embracing me), “do you mean it now?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“And now?” softly kissing my forehead and cheek.\n\n“I do,” extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.\n\n“Oh, Jane, this is bitter!\_ This—this is wicked.\_ It would not be wicked\nto love me.”\n\n“It would to obey you.”\n\nA wild look raised his brows—crossed his features: he rose; but he\nforebore yet.\_ I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I\nshook, I feared—but I resolved.\n\n“One instant, Jane.\_ Give one glance to my horrible life when you are\ngone.\_ All happiness will be torn away with you.\_ What then is left?\_\nFor a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to\nsome corpse in yonder churchyard.\_ What shall I do, Jane?\_ Where turn\nfor a companion and for some hope?”\n\n“Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.\_ Believe in heaven.\_ Hope to\nmeet again there.”\n\n“Then you will not yield?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?”\_ His voice\nrose.\n\n“I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.”\n\n“Then you snatch love and innocence from me?\_ You fling me back on lust\nfor a passion—vice for an occupation?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for\nmyself.\_ We were born to strive and endure—you as well as I: do so.\_ You\nwill forget me before I forget you.”\n\n“You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.\_ I declared I\ncould not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.\_ And what\na distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is\nproved by your conduct!\_ Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to\ndespair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the\nbreach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need\nfear to offend by living with me?”\n\nThis was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned\ntraitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.\_ They\nspoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.\_ “Oh,\ncomply!” it said.\_ “Think of his misery; think of his danger—look at his\nstate when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the\nrecklessness following on despair—soothe him; save him; love him; tell\nhim you love him and will be his.\_ Who in the world cares for you?\nor who will be injured by what you do?”\n\nStill indomitable was the reply—“I care for myself.\_ The more\nsolitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I\nwill respect myself.\_ I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by\nman.\_ I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and\nnot mad—as I am now.\_ Laws and principles are not for the times when\nthere is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and\nsoul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate\nthey shall be.\_ If at my individual convenience I might break them, what\nwould be their worth?\_ They have a worth—so I have always believed; and\nif I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with\nmy veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its\nthrobs.\_ Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have\nat this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.”\n\nI did.\_ Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.\_ His\nfury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,\nwhatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my\nwaist.\_ He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I\nfelt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and\nglow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the\ncertainty of ultimate safety.\_ The soul, fortunately, has an\ninterpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in\nthe eye.\_ My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I\ngave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed\nstrength almost exhausted.\n\n“Never,” said he, as he ground his teeth, “never was anything at once so\nfrail and so indomitable.\_ A mere reed she feels in my hand!”\_ (And he\nshook me with the force of his hold.)\_ “I could bend her with my finger\nand thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I\ncrushed her?\_ Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing\nlooking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern\ntriumph.\_ Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage,\nbeautiful creature!\_ If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage\nwill only let the captive loose.\_ Conqueror I might be of the house; but\nthe inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor\nof its clay dwelling-place.\_ And it is you, spirit—with will and energy,\nand virtue and purity—that I want: not alone your brittle frame.\_ Of\nyourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if\nyou would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an\nessence—you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.\_ Oh! come, Jane,\ncome!”\n\nAs he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.\_\nThe look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,\nhowever, would have succumbed now.\_ I had dared and baffled his fury; I\nmust elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.\n\n“You are going, Jane?”\n\n“I am going, sir.”\n\n“You are leaving me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You will not come?\_ You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?\_ My deep\nlove, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?”\n\nWhat unutterable pathos was in his voice!\_ How hard it was to reiterate\nfirmly, “I am going.”\n\n“Jane!”\n\n“Mr. Rochester!”\n\n“Withdraw, then,—I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.\_\nGo up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a\nglance on my sufferings—think of me.”\n\nHe turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.\_ “Oh, Jane! my\nhope—my love—my life!” broke in anguish from his lips.\_ Then came a\ndeep, strong sob.\n\nI had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back—walked back as\ndeterminedly as I had retreated.\_ I knelt down by him; I turned his face\nfrom the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my\nhand.\n\n“God bless you, my dear master!” I said.\_ “God keep you from harm and\nwrong—direct you, solace you—reward you well for your past kindness to\nme.”\n\n“Little Jane’s love would have been my best reward,” he answered;\n“without it, my heart is broken.\_ But Jane will give me her love:\nyes—nobly, generously.”\n\nUp the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;\nerect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at\nonce quitted the room.\n\n“Farewell!” was the cry of my heart as I left him.\_ Despair added,\n“Farewell for ever!”\n\n\n\n* * * *\n\n\n\nThat night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as\nI lay down in bed.\_ I was transported in thought to the scenes of\nchildhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night\nwas dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.\_ The light that long\nago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed\nglidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of\nthe obscured ceiling.\_ I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to\nclouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours\nshe is about to sever.\_ I watched her come—watched with the strangest\nanticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her\ndisk.\_ She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first\npenetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a\nwhite human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow\nearthward.\_ It gazed and gazed on me.\_ It spoke to my spirit:\nimmeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my\nheart—\n\n“My daughter, flee temptation.”\n\n“Mother, I will.”\n\nSo I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.\_ It was yet\nnight, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.\_ “It\ncannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,” thought I.\_\nI rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.\_ I knew\nwhere to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.\_ In seeking\nthese articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr.\nRochester had forced me to accept a few days ago.\_ I left that; it was\nnot mine: it was the visionary bride’s who had melted in air.\_ The other\narticles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings\n(it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet,\npinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put\non yet, and stole from my room.\n\n“Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!” I whispered, as I glided past her door.\_\n“Farewell, my darling Adèle!” I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.\_\nNo thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.\_ I had to\ndeceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.\n\nI would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my\nheart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was\nforced to stop also.\_ No sleep was there: the inmate was walking\nrestlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I\nlistened.\_ There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if\nI chose: I had but to go in and to say—\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till\ndeath,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.\_ I thought of\nthis.\n\nThat kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience\nfor day.\_ He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.\_ He\nwould have me sought for: vainly.\_ He would feel himself forsaken; his\nlove rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.\_ I thought of\nthis too.\_ My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided\non.\n\nDrearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did\nit mechanically.\_ I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I\nsought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the\nlock.\_ I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to\nwalk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.\_\nAll this I did without one sound.\_ I opened the door, passed out, shut\nit softly.\_ Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.\_ The great gates were closed\nand locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.\_ Through that\nI departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.\n\nA mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the\ncontrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often\nnoticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.\_ No\nreflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back;\nnot even one forward.\_ Not one thought was to be given either to the\npast or the future.\_ The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly\nsad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down\nmy energy.\_ The last was an awful blank: something like the world when\nthe deluge was gone by.\n\nI skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.\_ I believe\nit was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when\nI left the house, were soon wet with dew.\_ But I looked neither to\nrising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.\_ He who is taken out\nto pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers\nthat smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the\ndisseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I\nthought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I\nthought of what I left.\_ I could not help it.\_ I thought of him now—in\nhis room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would\nstay with him and be his.\_ I longed to be his; I panted to return: it\nwas not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.\_\nAs yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered.\_ I could go back and be\nhis comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.\_\nOh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how\nit goaded me!\_ It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when\nI tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther\nin.\_ Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to\ntheir mates; birds were emblems of love.\_ What was I?\_ In the midst of\nmy pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.\_ I\nhad no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect.\_ I had\ninjured—wounded—left my master.\_ I was hateful in my own eyes.\_ Still I\ncould not turn, nor retrace one step.\_ God must have led me on.\_ As to\nmy own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and\nstifled the other.\_ I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary\nway: fast, fast I went like one delirious.\_ A weakness, beginning\ninwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the\nground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.\_ I had some\nfear—or hope—that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling\nforwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet—as\neager and as determined as ever to reach the road.\n\nWhen I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and\nwhile I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.\_ I stood up and\nlifted my hand; it stopped.\_ I asked where it was going: the driver\nnamed a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no\nconnections.\_ I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said\nthirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to\nmake it do.\_ He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the\nvehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.\n\nGentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!\_ May your eyes never\nshed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.\_ May\nyou never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in\nthat hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the\ninstrument of evil to what you wholly love.\n"
