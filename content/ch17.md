title: "\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nMr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.\_ It was one\nafternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and\nwhile she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up\nand down a long beech avenue within sight of her.\n\nHe then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline\nVarens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a “grande\npassion.”\_ This passion Céline had professed to return with even\nsuperior ardour.\_ He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he\nbelieved, as he said, that she preferred his “taille d’athlète” to\nthe elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.\n\n“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the\nGallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;\ngave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres,\ndiamonds, dentelles, &c.\_ In short, I began the process of ruining\nmyself in the received style, like any other spoony.\_ I had not, it\nseems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction,\nbut trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch\nfrom the beaten centre.\_ I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all\nother spoonies.\_ Happening to call one evening when Céline did not\nexpect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired\nwith strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to\nbreathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.\_ No,—I\nexaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her:\nit was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk\nand amber, than an odour of sanctity.\_ I was just beginning to stifle\nwith the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I\nbethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.\_ It\nwas moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.\_ The\nbalcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a\ncigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”\n\nHere ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;\nhaving placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on\nthe freezing and sunless air, he went on—\n\n“I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was\ncroquant—(overlook the barbarism)—croquant chocolate comfits,\nand smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled\nalong the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when\nin an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English\nhorses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised\nthe ‘voiture’ I had given Céline.\_ She was returning: of course my heart\nthumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.\_ The\ncarriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that\nis the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a\ncloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June\nevening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the\nskirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step.\_ Bending over\nthe balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course,\nwhich should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped\nfrom the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel\nwhich had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now\npassed under the arched porte cochère of the hotel.\n\n“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?\_ Of course not: I need not\nask you; because you never felt love.\_ You have both sentiments yet to\nexperience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall\nwaken it.\_ You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in\nwhich your youth has hitherto slid away.\_ Floating on with closed eyes\nand muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the\nbed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.\_ But I tell\nyou—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy pass in\nthe channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up into\nwhirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on\ncrag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer\ncurrent—as I am now.\n\n“I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and\nstillness of the world under this frost.\_ I like Thornfield, its\nantiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey\nfaçade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet\nhow long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great\nplague-house?\_ How I do still abhor—”\n\nHe ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his\nboot against the hard ground.\_ Some hated thought seemed to have him in\nits grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.\n\nWe were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before\nus.\_ Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such\nas I never saw before or since.\_ Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,\ndetestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the\nlarge pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.\_ Wild was the wrestle which\nshould be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something\nhard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and\npetrified his countenance: he went on—\n\n“During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with\nmy destiny.\_ She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of\nthose who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.\_ ‘You like\nThornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air\na memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,\nbetween the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can!\_ Like\nit if you dare!’\n\n“‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and” (he subjoined moodily)\n“I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to\ngoodness—yes, goodness.\_ I wish to be a better man than I have been,\nthan I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the\nhabergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will\nesteem but straw and rotten wood.”\n\nAdèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock.\_ “Away!” he cried\nharshly; “keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!”\_ Continuing\nthen to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the\npoint whence he had abruptly diverged—\n\n“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens entered?”\n\nI almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on\nthe contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes\ntowards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.\_ “Oh, I had\nforgotten Céline!\_ Well, to resume.\_ When I saw my charmer thus come in\naccompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake\nof jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided\nwithin my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core.\_\nStrange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.\_\n“Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young\nlady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it\nwere the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories\nof his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!\_ But\nthe last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before:\nyou, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the\nrecipient of secrets.\_ Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed\nin communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take\ninfection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.\_ Happily I do not\nmean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.\_ The\nmore you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you\nmay refresh me.”\_ After this digression he proceeded—\n\n“I remained in the balcony.\_ ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’\nthought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’\_ So putting my hand in through\nthe open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening\nthrough which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all\nbut a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’ whispered\nvows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came\nin.\_ My eye was quickly at the aperture.\_ Céline’s chamber-maid entered,\nlit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.\_ The couple were thus\nrevealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was ‘the\nVarens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and there was\nher companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a young roué\nof a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in\nsociety, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so\nabsolutely.\_ On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was\ninstantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Céline sank\nunder an extinguisher.\_ A woman who could betray me for such a rival was\nnot worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than\nI, who had been her dupe.\n\n“They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,\nmercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary\nthan enrage a listener.\_ A card of mine lay on the table; this being\nperceived, brought my name under discussion.\_ Neither of them possessed\nenergy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely\nas they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed\nrather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.\_\nNow it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what\nshe called my ‘beauté mâle:’ wherein she differed diametrically from\nyou, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not\nthink me handsome.\_ The contrast struck me at the time and—”\n\nAdèle here came running up again.\n\n“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and\nwishes to see you.”\n\n“Ah! in that case I must abridge.\_ Opening the window, I walked in upon\nthem; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her\nhotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded\nscreams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an\nappointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.\_\nNext morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in\none of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the\npip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.\_ But unluckily the\nVarens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she\naffirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no\nproofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more\nlike me than she.\_ Some years after I had broken with the mother, she\nabandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.\_ I\nacknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me, nor\ndo I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she\nwas quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud\nof Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome\nsoil of an English country garden.\_ Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it;\nbut now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French\nopera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and\nprotégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have\nfound another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,\n&c.—Eh?”\n\n“No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I\nhave a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,\nparentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall cling\ncloser to her than before.\_ How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet\nof a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a\nlonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”\n\n“Oh, that is the light in which you view it!\_ Well, I must go in now;\nand you too: it darkens.”\n\nBut I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race\nwith her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.\_ When we went\nin, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept\nher there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking\neven some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to\nstray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of\ncharacter, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an\nEnglish mind.\_ Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to\nappreciate all that was good in her to the utmost.\_ I sought in her\ncountenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no\ntrait, no turn of expression announced relationship.\_ It was a pity: if\nshe could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought\nmore of her.\n\nIt was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,\nthat I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.\_ As he had\nsaid, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance\nof the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French\ndancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no\ndoubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the\nparoxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act\nof expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived\npleasure in the old hall and its environs.\_ I meditated wonderingly on\nthis incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present\ninexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master’s manner to\nmyself.\_ The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a\ntribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.\_ His\ndeportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at\nthe first.\_ I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling\nhauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he\nhad always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal\ninvitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception\nthat made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that\nthese evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my\nbenefit.\n\nI, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with\nrelish.\_ It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a\nmind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do\nnot mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their\ninterest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange\nnovelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in\nreceiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he\nportrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he\ndisclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.\n\nThe ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly\nfrankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to\nhim.\_ I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:\nyet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it\nwas his way.\_ So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest\nadded to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin\ncrescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled\nup; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.\n\nAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?\_ No, reader: gratitude, and\nmany associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object\nI best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the\nbrightest fire.\_ Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could\nnot, for he brought them frequently before me.\_ He was proud, sardonic,\nharsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that\nhis great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many\nothers.\_ He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when\nsent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with\nhis head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,\nalmost a malignant, scowl blackened his features.\_ But I believed that\nhis moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say\nformer, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in\nsome cruel cross of fate.\_ I believed he was naturally a man of better\ntendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as\ncircumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny\nencouraged.\_ I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for\nthe present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled.\_ I cannot\ndeny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have\ngiven much to assuage it.\n\nThough I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I\ncould not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,\nand told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be\nhappy at Thornfield.\n\n“Why not?” I asked myself.\_ “What alienates him from the house?\_ Will he\nleave it again soon?\_ Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer\nthan a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.\_\nIf he does go, the change will be doleful.\_ Suppose he should be absent\nspring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will\nseem!”\n\nI hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,\nI started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,\nwhich sounded, I thought, just above me.\_ I wished I had kept my candle\nburning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.\_ I rose\nand sat up in bed, listening.\_ The sound was hushed.\n\nI tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward\ntranquillity was broken.\_ The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.\_\nJust then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept\nthe panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.\_ I said,\n“Who is there?”\_ Nothing answered.\_ I was chilled with fear.\n\nAll at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the\nkitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up\nto the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there\nmyself in the mornings.\_ The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.\_\nSilence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again\nthrough the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.\_ But it\nwas not fated that I should sleep that night.\_ A dream had scarcely\napproached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing\nincident enough.\n\nThis was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it\nseemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.\_ The head of my bed was\nnear the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my\nbedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and\ncould see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was\nreiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.\_ My first impulse\nwas to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is\nthere?”\n\nSomething gurgled and moaned.\_ Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery\ntowards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut\nin that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.\n\n“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I.\_\nImpossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.\_ I\nhurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door\nwith a trembling hand.\_ There was a candle burning just outside, and on\nthe matting in the gallery.\_ I was surprised at this circumstance: but\nstill more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with\nsmoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence\nthese blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of\nburning.\n\nSomething creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.\nRochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.\_ I thought no\nmore of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in\nan instant, I was within the chamber.\_ Tongues of flame darted round the\nbed: the curtains were on fire.\_ In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr.\nRochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.\n\n“Wake! wake!” I cried.\_ I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:\nthe smoke had stupefied him.\_ Not a moment could be lost: the very\nsheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one\nwas wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water.\_ I heaved\nthem up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,\nbrought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid,\nsucceeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.\n\nThe hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I\nflung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of\nthe shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.\_\nThough it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him\nfulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of\nwater.\n\n“Is there a flood?” he cried.\n\n“No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are\nquenched now; I will fetch you a candle.”\n\n“In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he\ndemanded.\_ “What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?\_ Who is in the\nroom besides you?\_ Have you plotted to drown me?”\n\n“I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up.\_\nSomebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and\nwhat it is.”\n\n“There!\_ I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two\nminutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, here\nis my dressing-gown.\_ Now run!”\n\nI did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.\_ He\ntook it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened\nand scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\n\n“What is it? and who did it?” he asked.\_ I briefly related to him what\nhad transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step\nascending to the third storey; the smoke,—the smell of fire which had\nconducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and\nhow I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.\n\n\n\nHe listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern\nthan astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.\n\n“Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax?\_ No; what the deuce would you call her for?\_ What can she\ndo?\_ Let her sleep unmolested.”\n\n“Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.”\n\n“Not at all: just be still.\_ You have a shawl on.\_ If you are not warm\nenough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in\nthe arm-chair: there,—I will put it on.\_ Now place your feet on the\nstool, to keep them out of the wet.\_ I am going to leave you a few\nminutes.\_ I shall take the candle.\_ Remain where you are till I return;\nbe as still as a mouse.\_ I must pay a visit to the second storey.\_ Don’t\nmove, remember, or call any one.”\n\nHe went: I watched the light withdraw.\_ He passed up the gallery very\nsoftly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,\nshut it after him, and the last ray vanished.\_ I was left in total\ndarkness.\_ I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.\_ A very long\ntime elapsed.\_ I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and\nthen I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.\_\nI was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying\nhis orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,\nand I heard his unshod feet tread the matting.\_ “I hope it is he,”\nthought I, “and not something worse.”\n\nHe re-entered, pale and very gloomy.\_ “I have found it all out,” said\nhe, setting his candle down on the washstand; “it is as I thought.”\n\n“How, sir?”\n\nHe made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the\nground.\_ At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar\ntone—\n\n“I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber\ndoor.”\n\n“No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”\n\n“But you heard an odd laugh?\_ You have heard that laugh before, I should\nthink, or something like it?”\n\n“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she\nlaughs in that way.\_ She is a singular person.”\n\n“Just so.\_ Grace Poole—you have guessed it.\_ She is, as you say,\nsingular—very.\_ Well, I shall reflect on the subject.\_ Meantime, I am\nglad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the\nprecise details of to-night’s incident.\_ You are no talking fool: say\nnothing about it.\_ I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing\nto the bed): “and now return to your own room.\_ I shall do very well on\nthe sofa in the library for the rest of the night.\_ It is near four:—in\ntwo hours the servants will be up.”\n\n“Good-night, then, sir,” said I, departing.\n\nHe seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to\ngo.\n\n“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”\n\n“You said I might go, sir.”\n\n“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of\nacknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry\nfashion.\_ Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and\nexcruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual\nstrangers!\_ At least shake hands.”\n\nHe held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in\nboth his own.\n\n“You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a\ndebt.\_ I cannot say more.\_ Nothing else that has being would have been\ntolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but\nyou: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”\n\nHe paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but\nhis voice was checked.\n\n“Good-night again, sir.\_ There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,\nin the case.”\n\n“I knew,” he continued, “you would do me good in some way, at some\ntime;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression\nand smile did not”—(again he stopped)—“did not” (he proceeded hastily)\n“strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.\_ People talk of\nnatural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of\ntruth in the wildest fable.\_ My cherished preserver, goodnight!”\n\nStrange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.\n\n“I am glad I happened to be awake,” I said: and then I was going.\n\n“What! you will go?”\n\n“I am cold, sir.”\n\n“Cold?\_ Yes,—and standing in a pool!\_ Go, then, Jane; go!”\_ But he still\nretained my hand, and I could not free it.\_ I bethought myself of an\nexpedient.\n\n“I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,” said I.\n\n“Well, leave me:” he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.\n\nI regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.\_ Till morning dawned I\nwas tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled\nunder surges of joy.\_ I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a\nshore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,\nwakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I\ncould not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land,\nand continually drove me back.\_ Sense would resist delirium: judgment\nwould warn passion.\_ Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.\n"
