title: "\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nFive o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,\nwhen Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and\nnearly dressed.\_ I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had\nwashed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just\nsetting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.\_ I\nwas to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates\nat six a.m.\_ Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in\nthe nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.\_ Few children\ncan eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.\_\nBessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled\nmilk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a\npaper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse\nand bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the\nnursery.\_ As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you go in\nand bid Missis good-bye?”\n\n“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to\nsupper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins\neither; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best\nfriend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.”\n\n“What did you say, Miss?”\n\n“Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to\nthe wall.”\n\n“That was wrong, Miss Jane.”\n\n“It was quite right, Bessie.\_ Your Missis has not been my friend: she\nhas been my foe.”\n\n“O Miss Jane! don’t say so!”\n\n“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed through the hall and went\nout at the front door.\n\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose\nlight glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.\_ Raw\nand chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down\nthe drive.\_ There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it,\nwe found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had\nbeen carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.\_ It\nwanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,\nthe distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the\ndoor and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\n\n“Is she going by herself?” asked the porter’s wife.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And how far is it?”\n\n“Fifty miles.”\n\n“What a long way!\_ I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far\nalone.”\n\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and\nits top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged\nhaste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to which\nI clung with kisses.\n\n“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to the guard, as he\nlifted me into the inside.\n\n“Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed\n“All right,” and on we drove.\_ Thus was I severed from Bessie and\nGateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote\nand mysterious regions.\n\nI remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to\nme of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over\nhundreds of miles of road.\_ We passed through several towns, and in one,\na very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the\npassengers alighted to dine.\_ I was carried into an inn, where the guard\nwanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in\nan immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from\nthe ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled\nwith musical instruments.\_ Here I walked about for a long time, feeling\nvery strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and\nkidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having\nfrequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles.\_ At last the guard\nreturned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted\nhis own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the\n“stony street” of L-.\n\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I\nbegan to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we\nceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills\nheaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a\nvalley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the\nprospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\n\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered\nwhen the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,\nand a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress\nby the light of the lamps.\n\n“Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?” she asked.\_ I answered\n“Yes,” and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach\ninstantly drove away.\n\nI was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion\nof the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.\_ Rain, wind,\nand darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall\nbefore me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new\nguide: she shut and locked it behind her.\_ There was now visible a house\nor houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights\nburning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were\nadmitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a\nroom with a fire, where she left me alone.\n\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked\nround; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth\nshowed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany\nfurniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the\ndrawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough.\_ I was puzzling to\nmake out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and\nan individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.\n\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and\nlarge forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her\ncountenance was grave, her bearing erect.\n\n“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said she, putting her candle\ndown on the table.\_ She considered me attentively for a minute or two,\nthen further added—\n\n“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?” she\nasked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\n\n“A little, ma’am.”\n\n“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to\nbed, Miss Miller.\_ Is this the first time you have left your parents to\ncome to school, my little girl?”\n\nI explained to her that I had no parents.\_ She inquired how long they\nhad been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could\nread, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her\nforefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,” dismissed\nme along with Miss Miller.\n\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me\nappeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,\nand air.\_ Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of\na careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had\nalways a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I\nafterwards found she really was, an under-teacher.\_ Led by her, I passed\nfrom compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and\nirregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary\nsilence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came\nupon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,\nwith great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair\nof candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of\nevery age, from nine or ten to twenty.\_ Seen by the dim light of the\ndips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality\nexceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of\nquaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.\_ It was the hour of study;\nthey were engaged in conning over their to-morrow’s task, and the hum I\nhad heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.\n\nMiss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking\nup to the top of the long room she cried out—\n\n“Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!”\n\nFour tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered\nthe books and removed them.\_ Miss Miller again gave the word of command—\n\n“Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!”\n\nThe tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray,\nwith portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a\npitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray.\_ The portions were\nhanded round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being\ncommon to all.\_ When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but\ndid not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of\neating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into\nfragments.\n\nThe meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed\noff, two and two, upstairs.\_ Overpowered by this time with weariness, I\nscarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like\nthe schoolroom, I saw it was very long.\_ To-night I was to be Miss\nMiller’s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced\nat the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two\noccupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst\nsilence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\n\nThe night passed rapidly.\_ I was too tired even to dream; I only once\nawoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in\ntorrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my\nside.\_ When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls\nwere up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or\ntwo burned in the room.\_ I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and\nI dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a\nbasin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin\nto six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.\_ Again the bell\nrang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the\nstairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were\nread by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—\n\n“Form classes!”\n\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller\nrepeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!”\_ When it subsided, I saw\nthem all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the\nfour tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a\nBible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.\_ A pause of some\nseconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss\nMiller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\n\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each\nwalked to a table and took her seat.\_ Miss Miller assumed the fourth\nvacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the\nsmallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was\ncalled, and placed at the bottom of it.\n\nBusiness now began, the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts\nof Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of\nchapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.\_ By the time that exercise\nwas terminated, day had fully dawned.\_ The indefatigable bell now\nsounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched\ninto another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of\ngetting something to eat!\_ I was now nearly sick from inanition, having\ntaken so little the day before.\n\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables\nsmoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth\nan odour far from inviting.\_ I saw a universal manifestation of\ndiscontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those\ndestined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls\nof the first class, rose the whispered words—\n\n“Disgusting!\_ The porridge is burnt again!”\n\n“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the\nupper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of\nsomewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,\nwhile a more buxom lady presided at the other.\_ I looked in vain for her\nI had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller\noccupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,\nforeign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards\nfound, took the corresponding seat at the other board.\_ A long grace was\nsaid and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the\nteachers, and the meal began.\n\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion\nwithout thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I\nperceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as\nbad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.\_ The spoons\nwere moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;\nbut in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.\_ Breakfast was over,\nand none had breakfasted.\_ Thanks being returned for what we had not\ngot, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the\nschoolroom.\_ I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,\nI saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked\nat the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of\nthem, the stout one, whispered—\n\n“Abominable stuff!\_ How shameful!”\n\nA quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the\nschoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to\nbe permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their\nprivilege.\_ The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and\nall abused roundly.\_ Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.\_\nMiss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls\nstanding about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.\_ I heard the\nname of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller\nshook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the\ngeneral wrath; doubtless she shared in it.\n\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and\nstanding in the middle of the room, cried—\n\n“Silence!\_ To your seats!”\n\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved\ninto order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of\ntongues.\_ The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but\nstill, all seemed to wait.\_ Ranged on benches down the sides of the\nroom, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage\nthey appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl\nvisible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker\nabout the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like\na Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to\nserve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and\ncountry-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles.\_ Above twenty of those\nclad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it\nsuited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.\n\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the\nteachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a\nlittle coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and\ngrotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,\nand over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole\nschool rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.\n\nWhat was the matter?\_ I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.\_ Ere I\nhad gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes\nwere now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and\nencountered the personage who had received me last night.\_ She stood at\nthe bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each\nend; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.\_ Miss\nMiller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received\nher answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—\n\n“Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”\n\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly\nup the room.\_ I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I\nretain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her\nsteps.\_ Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely;\nbrown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling\nof long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each\nof her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round\ncurls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth\nbands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of\nthe day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of\nblack velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now)\nshone at her girdle.\_ Let the reader add, to complete the picture,\nrefined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and\ncarriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a\ncorrect idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I\nafterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to\ncarry to church.\n\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her\nseat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the\nfirst class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the\nlower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,\ngrammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and\nmusic lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.\_ The\nduration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck\ntwelve.\_ The superintendent rose—\n\n“I have a word to address to the pupils,” said she.\n\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it\nsank at her voice.\_ She went on—\n\n“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be\nhungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served\nto all.”\n\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\n\n“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory\ntone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\n\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the\nhigh delight and refreshment of the whole school.\_ The order was now\ngiven “To the garden!”\_ Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings\nof coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.\_ I was similarly\nequipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.\n\nThe garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to\nexclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,\nand broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little\nbeds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,\nand each bed had an owner.\_ When full of flowers they would doubtless\nlook pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry\nblight and brown decay.\_ I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it\nwas an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but\ndarkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet\nwith the floods of yesterday.\_ The stronger among the girls ran about\nand engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded\ntogether for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as\nthe dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently\nthe sound of a hollow cough.\n\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of\nme; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was\naccustomed; it did not oppress me much.\_ I leant against a pillar of the\nverandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the\ncold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me\nwithin, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.\_\nMy reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I\nhardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated\naway to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and\nof the future I could form no conjecture.\_ I looked round the\nconvent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large building, half of\nwhich seemed grey and old, the other half quite new.\_ The new part,\ncontaining the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and\nlatticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet\nover the door bore this inscription:—\n\n“Lowood Institution.—This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi\nBrocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.”\_ “Let your light so\nshine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your\nFather which is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.\n\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation\nbelonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.\_ I was\nstill pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to\nmake out a connection between the first words and the verse of\nScripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my\nhead.\_ I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a\nbook, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I\ncould see the title—it was “Rasselas;” a name that struck me as strange,\nand consequently attractive.\_ In turning a leaf she happened to look up,\nand I said to her directly—\n\n“Is your book interesting?”\_ I had already formed the intention of\nasking her to lend it to me some day.\n\n“I like it,” she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during\nwhich she examined me.\n\n“What is it about?” I continued.\_ I hardly know where I found the\nhardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was\ncontrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a\nchord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a\nfrivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the\nserious or substantial.\n\n“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book.\n\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less\ntaking than the title: “Rasselas” looked dull to my trifling taste; I\nsaw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed\nspread over the closely-printed pages.\_ I returned it to her; she\nreceived it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to\nrelapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—\n\n“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?\_\nWhat is Lowood Institution?”\n\n“This house where you are come to live.”\n\n“And why do they call it Institution?\_ Is it in any way different from\nother schools?”\n\n“It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are\ncharity-children.\_ I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your\nfather or your mother dead?”\n\n“Both died before I can remember.”\n\n“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this\nis called an institution for educating orphans.”\n\n“Do we pay no money?\_ Do they keep us for nothing?”\n\n“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”\n\n“Then why do they call us charity-children?”\n\n“Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the\ndeficiency is supplied by subscription.”\n\n“Who subscribes?”\n\n“Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood\nand in London.”\n\n“Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?”\n\n“The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,\nand whose son overlooks and directs everything here.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.”\n\n“Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch,\nand who said we were to have some bread and cheese?”\n\n“To Miss Temple?\_ Oh, no!\_ I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.\nBrocklehurst for all she does.\_ Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and\nall our clothes.”\n\n“Does he live here?”\n\n“No—two miles off, at a large hall.”\n\n“Is he a good man?”\n\n“He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.”\n\n“Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And what are the other teachers called?”\n\n“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,\nand cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and\neverything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she\nteaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and\nthe one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her\nside with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in\nFrance, and teaches French.”\n\n“Do you like the teachers?”\n\n“Well enough.”\n\n“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?—I cannot\npronounce her name as you do.”\n\n“Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her; Madame\nPierrot is not a bad sort of person.”\n\n“But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t she?”\n\n“Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest,\nbecause she knows far more than they do.”\n\n“Have you been long here?”\n\n“Two years.”\n\n“Are you an orphan?”\n\n“My mother is dead.”\n\n“Are you happy here?”\n\n“You ask rather too many questions.\_ I have given you answers enough for\nthe present: now I want to read.”\n\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the\nhouse.\_ The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more\nappetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the\ndinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong\nsteam redolent of rancid fat.\_ I found the mess to consist of\nindifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked\ntogether.\_ Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was\napportioned to each pupil.\_ I ate what I could, and wondered within\nmyself whether every day’s fare would be like this.\n\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons\nrecommenced, and were continued till five o’clock.\n\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with\nwhom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss\nScatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the\nlarge schoolroom.\_ The punishment seemed to me in a high degree\nignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or\nupwards.\_ I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame;\nbut to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave,\nshe stood, the central mark of all eyes.\_ “How can she bear it so\nquietly—so firmly?” I asked of myself.\_ “Were I in her place, it seems\nto me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.\_ She looks as\nif she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her\nsituation: of something not round her nor before her.\_ I have heard of\nday-dreams—is she in a day-dream now?\_ Her eyes are fixed on the floor,\nbut I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down\ninto her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not\nat what is really present.\_ I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether\ngood or naughty.”\n\nSoon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of\ncoffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.\_ I devoured my bread and drank\nmy coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I was\nstill hungry.\_ Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then the\nglass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.\_ Such was my\nfirst day at Lowood.\n"
