title: "\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nBut the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.\_ Spring\ndrew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;\nits snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.\_ My wretched feet,\nflayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to\nheal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and\nmornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in\nour veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:\nsometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a\ngreenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested\nthe thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning\nbrighter traces of her steps.\_ Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;\nsnow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.\_ On\nThursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still\nsweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.\n\nI discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon\nonly bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our\ngarden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a\ngreat hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of\ndark stones and sparkling eddies.\_ How different had this scene looked\nwhen I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in\nfrost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death wandered to the\nimpulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down “ing”\nand holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!\_ That beck\nitself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the\nwood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild\nrain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed\nonly ranks of skeletons.\n\nApril advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,\nplacid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its\nduration.\_ And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose\nits tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and\noak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up\nprofusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its\nhollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its\nwild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed\nspots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.\_ All this I enjoyed often\nand fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty\nand pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to\nadvert.\n\nHave I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it\nas bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?\_\nAssuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another\nquestion.\n\nThat forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred\npestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the\nOrphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and\ndormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an\nhospital.\n\nSemi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils\nto receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one\ntime.\_ Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.\_ The few who continued\nwell were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical\nattendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in\nhealth: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or\nrestrain them.\_ Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the\npatients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch\na few hours’ rest at night.\_ The teachers were fully occupied with\npacking up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of\nthose girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able\nand willing to remove them from the seat of contagion.\_ Many, already\nsmitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried\nquietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.\n\nWhile disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its\nfrequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while\nits rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the\npastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that\nbright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland\nout of doors.\_ Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had\nsprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in\nbloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and\ncrimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening,\ntheir scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all\nuseless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and\nthen a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.\n\nBut I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of\nthe scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from\nmorning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived\nbetter too.\_ Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:\nhousehold matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was\ngone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been\nmatron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,\nprovided with comparative liberality.\_ Besides, there were fewer to\nfeed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better\nfilled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often\nhappened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice\nof bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where\nwe each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.\n\nMy favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry\nfrom the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading\nthrough the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.\_ The stone was just\nbroad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that\ntime my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant\npersonage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was\nwitty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at\nmy ease.\_ Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could\ntell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found\ngratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never\nimposing curb or rein on anything I said.\_ She had a turn for narrative,\nI for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on\nswimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much\nimprovement, from our mutual intercourse.\n\nAnd where, meantime, was Helen Burns?\_ Why did I not spend these sweet\ndays of liberty with her?\_ Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as\nto have grown tired of her pure society?\_ Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I\nhave mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only\ntell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I\nchose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was\nqualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a\ntaste of far higher things.\n\nTrue, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective\nbeing, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of\nHelen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of\nattachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated\nmy heart.\_ How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under\nall circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which\nill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?\_ But Helen was\nill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I\nknew not what room upstairs.\_ She was not, I was told, in the hospital\nportion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was\nconsumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,\nunderstood something mild, which time and care would be sure to\nalleviate.\n\nI was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming\ndownstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple\ninto the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and\nspeak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not\ndistinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the\nverandah.\n\nOne evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with\nMary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the\nothers, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to\nask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked\nafter a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.\_ When\nwe got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the\nsurgeon’s, was standing at the garden door.\_ Mary Ann remarked that she\nsupposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at\nthat time of the evening.\_ She went into the house; I stayed behind a\nfew minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the\nforest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the\nmorning.\_ This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt\nso sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so\nwarm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the\nmorrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east.\_ I was noting\nthese things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind\nas it had never done before:—\n\n“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!\_\nThis world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to\nhave to go who knows where?”\n\nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had\nbeen infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time\nit recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each\nside, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the\none point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud\nand vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and\nplunging amid that chaos.\_ While pondering this new idea, I heard the\nfront door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.\_ After\nshe had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the\ndoor, but I ran up to her.\n\n“How is Helen Burns?”\n\n“Very poorly,” was the answer.\n\n“Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And what does he say about her?”\n\n“He says she’ll not be here long.”\n\nThis phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed\nthe notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her\nown home.\_ I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but\nI knew instantly now!\_ It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen\nBurns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going\nto be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.\_ I\nexperienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a\ndesire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.\n\n“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the nurse.\n\n“May I go up and speak to her?”\n\n“Oh no, child!\_ It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;\nyou’ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.”\n\nThe nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which\nled to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and Miss\nMiller was calling the pupils to go to bed.\n\nIt might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having\nbeen able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the\ndormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose\nsoftly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept\nfrom the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room.\_ It was\nquite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of\nthe unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,\nenabled me to find it without difficulty.\_ An odour of camphor and burnt\nvinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door\nquickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.\_ I\ndreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see Helen,—I must\nembrace her before she died,—I must give her one last kiss, exchange\nwith her one last word.\n\nHaving descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below,\nand succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I\nreached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite\nto me was Miss Temple’s room.\_ A light shone through the keyhole and\nfrom under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.\_ Coming\nnear, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air\ninto the close abode of sickness.\_ Indisposed to hesitate, and full of\nimpatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with keen throes—I put it\nback and looked in.\_ My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.\n\nClose by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains,\nthere stood a little crib.\_ I saw the outline of a form under the\nclothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to\nin the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt\ndimly on the table.\_ Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards\nthat she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.\_ I\nadvanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but\nI preferred speaking before I withdrew it.\_ I still recoiled at the\ndread of seeing a corpse.\n\n“Helen!” I whispered softly, “are you awake?”\n\nShe stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,\nwasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear\nwas instantly dissipated.\n\n“Can it be you, Jane?” she asked, in her own gentle voice.\n\n“Oh!” I thought, “she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could\nnot speak and look so calmly if she were.”\n\nI got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her\ncheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled\nas of old.\n\n“Why are you come here, Jane?\_ It is past eleven o’clock: I heard it\nstrike some minutes since.”\n\n“I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not\nsleep till I had spoken to you.”\n\n“You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.”\n\n“Are you going somewhere, Helen?\_ Are you going home?”\n\n“Yes; to my long home—my last home.”\n\n“No, no, Helen!”\_ I stopped, distressed.\_ While I tried to devour my\ntears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the\nnurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she\nwhispered—\n\n“Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my\nquilt.”\n\nI did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.\_ After a\nlong silence, she resumed, still whispering—\n\n“I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be\nsure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.\_ We all must die\none day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is\ngentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.\_ I leave no one to regret me\nmuch: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss\nme.\_ By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.\_ I had not\nqualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should\nhave been continually at fault.”\n\n“But where are you going to, Helen?\_ Can you see?\_ Do you know?”\n\n“I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.”\n\n“Where is God?\_ What is God?”\n\n“My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.\_ I rely\nimplicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the\nhours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,\nreveal Him to me.”\n\n“You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and\nthat our souls can get to it when we die?”\n\n“I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign\nmy immortal part to Him without any misgiving.\_ God is my father; God is\nmy friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.”\n\n“And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?”\n\n“You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same\nmighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.”\n\nAgain I questioned, but this time only in thought.\_ “Where is that\nregion?\_ Does it exist?”\_ And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she\nseemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I\nlay with my face hidden on her neck.\_ Presently she said, in the\nsweetest tone—\n\n“How comfortable I am!\_ That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;\nI feel as if I could sleep: but don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have you\nnear me.”\n\n“I’ll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.”\n\n“Are you warm, darling?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good-night, Jane.”\n\n“Good-night, Helen.”\n\nShe kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.\n\nWhen I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I\nwas in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through\nthe passage back to the dormitory.\_ I was not reprimanded for leaving my\nbed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was\nafforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I\nlearned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had\nfound me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns’s\nshoulder, my arms round her neck.\_ I was asleep, and Helen was—dead.\n\nHer grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her\ndeath it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble\ntablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word “Resurgam.”\n"
