title: "\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nFor several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.\_ In the\nmornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,\ngentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes\nstayed to dine with him.\_ When his sprain was well enough to admit of\nhorse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these\nvisits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.\n\nDuring this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence,\nand all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre\nin the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes\npass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a\ndistant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with\ngentlemanlike affability.\_ His changes of mood did not offend me,\nbecause I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb\nand flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.\n\nOne day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in\norder, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away\nearly, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed\nme; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not\naccompany them.\_ Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message\ncame that I and Adèle were to go downstairs.\_ I brushed Adèle’s hair and\nmade her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual\nQuaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and\nplain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended,\nAdèle wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for,\nowing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.\_ She was\ngratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered\nthe dining-room.\_ She appeared to know it by instinct.\n\n“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.\n\n“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine\ndaughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the\ndeep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the\ndepths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.\_ “And mind,” he\ncontinued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process,\nor any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be\nconducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”\n\nAdèle seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had already retired to a\nsofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the\nlid.\_ Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery\nenvelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—\n\n“Oh ciel!\_ Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic\ncontemplation.\n\n“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his seat\nto look round to the door, near which I still stood.\n\n“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.”\_ He drew a chair near his\nown.\_ “I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for,\nold bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with\ntheir lisp.\_ It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening\ntête-à-tête with a brat.\_ Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss\nEyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.\_\nConfound these civilities!\_ I continually forget them.\_ Nor do I\nparticularly affect simple-minded old ladies.\_ By-the-bye, I must have\nmine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to\none; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”\n\nHe rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,\nknitting-basket in hand.\n\n“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.\_ I have\nforbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting\nwith repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and\ninterlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever\nperformed.”\n\nAdèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her\nsofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,\nthe waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations\nand raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.\n\n“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester,\n“put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at\nliberty to attend to my own pleasure.\_ Miss Eyre, draw your chair still\na little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you\nwithout disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have\nno mind to do.”\n\nI did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in\nthe shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it\nseemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.\n\nWe were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been\nlit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the\nlarge fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and\nample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still,\nsave the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling\nup each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.\n\nMr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different\nto what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less\ngloomy.\_ There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether\nwith wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.\_ He was,\nin short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also\nmore self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;\nstill he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the\nswelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his\ngranite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great,\ndark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their\ndepths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least,\nof that feeling.\n\nHe had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the\nsame length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze\nfastened on his physiognomy.\n\n“You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do you think me handsome?”\n\nI should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by\nsomething conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow\nslipped from my tongue before I was aware—“No, sir.”\n\n“Ah!\_ By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you\nhave the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple,\nas you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on\nthe carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my\nface; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or\nmakes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round\nrejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.\_ What do you mean\nby it?”\n\n“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.\_ I ought to have replied that\nit was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about\nappearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little\nconsequence, or something of that sort.”\n\n“You ought to have replied no such thing.\_ Beauty of little consequence,\nindeed!\_ And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of\nstroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under\nmy ear!\_ Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?\_ I suppose I have\nall my limbs and all my features like any other man?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no\npointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”\n\n“Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.\_ Criticise me:\ndoes my forehead not please you?”\n\nHe lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his\nbrow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an\nabrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.\n\n“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”\n\n“Far from it, sir.\_ You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in\nreturn whether you are a philanthropist?”\n\n“There again!\_ Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat\nmy head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of\nchildren and old women (low be it spoken!).\_ No, young lady, I am not a\ngeneral philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to the\nprominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,\nfortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a\nmarked breadth to the upper part of his head: “and, besides, I once had\na kind of rude tenderness of heart.\_ When I was as old as you, I was a\nfeeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and\nunlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me\nwith her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an\nIndia-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and\nwith one sentient point in the middle of the lump.\_ Yes: does that leave\nhope for me?”\n\n“Hope of what, sir?”\n\n“Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?”\n\n“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought; and I did not know what\nanswer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was\ncapable of being re-transformed?\n\n“You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty\nany more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it\nis convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my\nphysiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so\npuzzle on.\_ Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative\nto-night.”\n\nWith this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his\narm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen\nplainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest,\ndisproportionate almost to his length of limb.\_ I am sure most people\nwould have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious\npride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of\ncomplete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a\nreliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to\natone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at\nhim, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind,\nimperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.\n\n“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,” he\nrepeated, “and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier\nwere not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none\nof these can talk.\_ Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the\nmark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will:\nyou puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.\_ I have almost\nforgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but\nto-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and\nrecall what pleases.\_ It would please me now to draw you out—to learn\nmore of you—therefore speak.”\n\nInstead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive\nsmile either.\n\n“Speak,” he urged.\n\n“What about, sir?”\n\n“Whatever you like.\_ I leave both the choice of subject and the manner\nof treating it entirely to yourself.”\n\nAccordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to talk for the\nmere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed\nhimself to the wrong person,” I thought.\n\n“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”\n\nI was dumb still.\_ He bent his head a little towards me, and with a\nsingle hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.\n\n“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed.\_ Ah! it is consistent.\_ I put my\nrequest in an absurd, almost insolent form.\_ Miss Eyre, I beg your\npardon.\_ The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an\ninferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim only such superiority\nas must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s\nadvance in experience.\_ This is legitimate, et j’y tiens, as Adèle\nwould say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that\nI desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert\nmy thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a\nrusty nail.”\n\nHe had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel\ninsensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.\n\n“I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot\nintroduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?\_ Ask me\nquestions, and I will do my best to answer them.”\n\n“Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to\nbe a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the\ngrounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and\nthat I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many\nnations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly\nwith one set of people in one house?”\n\n“Do as you please, sir.”\n\n“That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very\nevasive one.\_ Reply clearly.”\n\n“I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you\nare older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I\nhave; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your\ntime and experience.”\n\n“Humph!\_ Promptly spoken.\_ But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would\nnever suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use\nof both advantages.\_ Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you\nmust still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued\nor hurt by the tone of command.\_ Will you?”\n\nI smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar—he seems to\nforget that he pays me £30 per annum for receiving his orders.\n\n“The smile is very well,” said he, catching instantly the passing\nexpression; “but speak too.”\n\n“I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to\ninquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by\ntheir orders.”\n\n“Paid subordinates!\_ What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?\_ Oh\nyes, I had forgotten the salary!\_ Well then, on that mercenary ground,\nwill you agree to let me hector a little?”\n\n“No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,\nand that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his\ndependency, I agree heartily.”\n\n“And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms\nand phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?”\n\n“I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I\nrather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a\nsalary.”\n\n“Humbug!\_ Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;\ntherefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which\nyou are intensely ignorant.\_ However, I mentally shake hands with you\nfor your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in\nwhich it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was\nfrank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the\ncontrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded\nmisapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour.\_ Not\nthree in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered\nme as you have just done.\_ But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are\ncast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours:\nNature did it.\_ And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions:\nfor what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have\nintolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.”\n\n“And so may you,” I thought.\_ My eye met his as the idea crossed my\nmind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been\nspoken as well as imagined—\n\n“Yes, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have plenty of faults of my own:\nI know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you.\_ God wot I\nneed not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series\nof deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which\nmight well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.\_ I\nstarted, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the\nblame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong\ntack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right\ncourse since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as\ngood as you—wiser—almost as stainless.\_ I envy you your peace of mind,\nyour clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.\_ Little girl, a memory\nwithout blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an\ninexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?”\n\n“How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?”\n\n“All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned\nit to fetid puddle.\_ I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal.\_\nNature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the\nbetter kind, and you see I am not so.\_ You would say you don’t see it;\nat least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware,\nby-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting\nits language).\_ Then take my word for it,—I am not a villain: you are\nnot to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but,\nowing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural\nbent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty\ndissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life.\_ Do\nyou wonder that I avow this to you?\_ Know, that in the course of your\nfuture life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary\nconfidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find\nout, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but\nto listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you\nlisten with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind\nof innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it\nis very unobtrusive in its manifestations.”\n\n“How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?”\n\n“I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were\nwriting my thoughts in a diary.\_ You would say, I should have been\nsuperior to circumstances; so I should—so I should; but you see I was\nnot.\_ When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I\nturned desperate; then I degenerated.\_ Now, when any vicious simpleton\nexcites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that\nI am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a\nlevel.\_ I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do!\_ Dread remorse when you\nare tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.”\n\n“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”\n\n“It is not its cure.\_ Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I\nhave strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it,\nhampered, burdened, cursed as I am?\_ Besides, since happiness is\nirrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I\nwill get it, cost what it may.”\n\n“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”\n\n“Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?\_ And I\nmay get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the\nmoor.”\n\n“It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.”\n\n“How do you know?—you never tried it.\_ How very serious—how very solemn\nyou look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head”\n(taking one from the mantelpiece).\_ “You have no right to preach to me,\nyou neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely\nunacquainted with its mysteries.”\n\n“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought\nremorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.”\n\n“And who talks of error now?\_ I scarcely think the notion that flittered\nacross my brain was an error.\_ I believe it was an inspiration rather\nthan a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that.\_ Here\nit comes again!\_ It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put\non the robes of an angel of light.\_ I think I must admit so fair a guest\nwhen it asks entrance to my heart.”\n\n“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”\n\n“Once more, how do you know?\_ By what instinct do you pretend to\ndistinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from\nthe eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?”\n\n“I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the\nsuggestion had returned upon you.\_ I feel sure it will work you more\nmisery if you listen to it.”\n\n“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the\nrest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy.\_\nHere, come in, bonny wanderer!”\n\nHe said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his\nown; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest,\nhe seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.\n\n“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I have received the pilgrim—a\ndisguised deity, as I verily believe.\_ Already it has done me good: my\nheart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.”\n\n“To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: I cannot keep up\nthe conversation, because it has got out of my depth.\_ Only one thing, I\nknow: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that\nyou regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you\nintimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.\_ It seems\nto me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to\nbecome what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you\nbegan with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in\na few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to\nwhich you might revert with pleasure.”\n\n“Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am\npaving hell with energy.”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.\_\nCertainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have\nbeen.”\n\n“And better?”\n\n“And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.\_ You seem to\ndoubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives\nare; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes\nand Persians, that both are right.”\n\n“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.”\n\n“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:\nunheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.”\n\n“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it\nis liable to abuse.”\n\n“Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to\nabuse it.”\n\n“You are human and fallible.”\n\n“I am: so are you—what then?”\n\n“The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the\ndivine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.”\n\n“What power?”\n\n“That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,—‘Let it be\nright.’”\n\n“‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.”\n\n“May it be right then,” I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to\ncontinue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides,\nsensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my\npenetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the\nuncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a\nconviction of ignorance.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To put Adèle to bed: it is past her bedtime.”\n\n“You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.”\n\n“Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am\ncertainly not afraid.”\n\n“You are afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.”\n\n“In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.”\n\n“If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake\nit for sense.\_ Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?\_ Don’t trouble yourself to\nanswer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe\nme, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally\nvicious.\_ The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat;\ncontrolling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your\nlimbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father, or\nmaster, or what you will—to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move\ntoo quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me,\nas I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks\nand movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer\nnow.\_ I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through\nthe close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is\nthere; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.\_ You are still bent\non going?”\n\n“It has struck nine, sir.”\n\n“Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not ready to go to bed yet.\_ My\nposition, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,\nfavours observation.\_ While talking to you, I have also occasionally\nwatched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious\nstudy,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).\_\nShe pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk\nfrock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her\nblood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.\_ ‘Il\nfaut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à l’instant même!’ and she rushed\nout of the room.\_ She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process:\nin a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,—a\nminiature of Céline Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the\nrising of—But never mind that.\_ However, my tenderest feelings are about\nto receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it\nwill be realised.”\n\nEre long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall.\_ She\nentered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.\_ A dress of\nrose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be\ngathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of\nrosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings\nand small white satin sandals.\n\n“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding forwards; “et mes\nsouliers? et mes bas?\_ Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!”\n\nAnd spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the room till, having\nreached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,\nthen dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—\n\n“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonté;” then rising, she\nadded, “C’est comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas, monsieur?”\n\n“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my\nEnglish gold out of my British breeches’ pocket.\_ I have been green,\ntoo, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now\nthan once freshened me.\_ My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me\nthat French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be\nrid of.\_ Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it\nwas of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half\na liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just\nnow.\_ I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of\nexpiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.\_ I’ll explain\nall this some day.\_ Good-night.”\n"
