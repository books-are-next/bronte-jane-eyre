title: "\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nFrom my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference\nbetween Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a\nmotive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I desired and\nwaited it in silence.\_ It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had\nregained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the\nsubject over which I brooded.\_ Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a\nsevere eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a\nmore marked line of separation than ever between me and her own\nchildren; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning\nme to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my\ncousins were constantly in the drawing-room.\_ Not a hint, however, did\nshe drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive\ncertainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with\nher; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an\ninsuperable and rooted aversion.\n\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me\nas little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he\nsaw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned\nagainst him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate\nrevolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to\ndesist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst\nhis nose.\_ I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a\nblow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my\nlook daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my\nadvantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama.\_ I heard him in\na blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had\nflown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—\n\n“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is\nnot worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters\nshould associate with her.”\n\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at\nall deliberating on my words—\n\n“They are not fit to associate with me.”\n\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and\naudacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a\nwhirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,\ndared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one\nsyllable during the remainder of the day.\n\n“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely\nvoluntary demand.\_ I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my\ntongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:\nsomething spoke out of me over which I had no control.\n\n“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey\neye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my\narm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child\nor fiend.\_ I was now in for it.\n\n“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so\ncan papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how\nyou wish me dead.”\n\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed\nboth my ears, and then left me without a word.\_ Bessie supplied the\nhiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond a\ndoubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a\nroof.\_ I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging\nin my breast.\n\nNovember, December, and half of January passed away.\_ Christmas and the\nNew Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;\npresents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.\_ From\nevery enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety\nconsisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,\nand seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin\nfrocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and\nafterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played\nbelow, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the\njingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken\nhum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.\_ When\ntired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the\nsolitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not\nmiserable.\_ To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,\nfor in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been\nkind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the\nevenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable\neye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.\_ But Bessie,\nas soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to\nthe lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally\nbearing the candle along with her.\_ I then sat with my doll on my knee\ntill the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that\nnothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers\nsank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as\nI best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.\_ To\nthis crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and,\nin the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a\npleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a\nminiature scarecrow.\_ It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd\nsincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and\ncapable of sensation.\_ I could not sleep unless it was folded in my\nnight-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively\nhappy, believing it to be happy likewise.\n\nLong did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and\nlistened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes she\nwould come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or\nperhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a\ncheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had\nfinished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,\nand said, “Good night, Miss Jane.”\_ When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to\nme the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most\nintensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never\npush me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often\nwont to do.\_ Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural\ncapacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack\nof narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by\nher nursery tales.\_ She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face\nand person are correct.\_ I remember her as a slim young woman, with\nblack hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion;\nbut she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of\nprinciple or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one\nelse at Gateshead Hall.\n\nIt was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning:\nBessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned\nto their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to\ngo and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not\nless so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money\nshe thus obtained.\_ She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity\nfor saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also\nin driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds,\nand slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to\nbuy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to\nsell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have\nmade a handsome profit thereby.\_ As to her money, she first secreted it\nin odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these\nhoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one\nday losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother,\nat a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest\nshe exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with\nanxious accuracy.\n\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and\ninterweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of\nwhich she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.\_ I was making my\nbed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before\nshe returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of\nunder-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).\_ Having\nspread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to\nput in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered\nthere; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for\nthe tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her\nproperty) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other\noccupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the\nwindow was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which\nI might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under\nthe influence of a hard frost.\n\nFrom this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage-road,\nand just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling\nthe panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a\ncarriage roll through.\_ I watched it ascending the drive with\nindifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought\nvisitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the\ndoor-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.\_ All this being\nnothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the\nspectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the\ntwigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the\ncasement.\_ The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the\ntable, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash\nto put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running\nupstairs into the nursery.\n\n“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?\_ Have you\nwashed your hands and face this morning?”\_ I gave another tug before I\nanswered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash\nyielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the\ncherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—\n\n“No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.”\n\n“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?\_ You look\nquite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening\nthe window for?”\n\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a\nhurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,\ninflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with\nsoap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly\nbrush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the\nstairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.\n\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was\nthere; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon\nme.\_ I slowly descended.\_ For nearly three months, I had never been\ncalled to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the\nbreakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions,\non which it dismayed me to intrude.\n\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door,\nand I stopped, intimidated and trembling.\_ What a miserable little\npoltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those\ndays!\_ I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to\nthe parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement\nringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.\n\n“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the\nstiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.\_\n“What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a\nwoman?”\_ The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and\ncurtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared\nto me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing\nerect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,\nplaced above the shaft by way of capital.\n\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to\nme to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger\nwith the words: “This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to\nyou.”\n\nHe, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,\nand having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which\ntwinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass\nvoice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”\n\n“Ten years.”\n\n“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for\nsome minutes.\_ Presently he addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”\n\n“Jane Eyre, sir.”\n\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;\nbut then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all\nthe lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\n\n“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”\n\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a\ncontrary opinion: I was silent.\_ Mrs. Reed answered for me by an\nexpressive shake of the head, adding soon, “Perhaps the less said on\nthat subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.”\n\n“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;” and bending\nfrom the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair\nopposite Mrs. Reed’s.\_ “Come here,” he said.\n\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.\_\nWhat a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a\ngreat nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!\n\n“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a\nnaughty little girl.\_ Do you know where the wicked go after death?”\n\n“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox answer.\n\n“And what is hell?\_ Can you tell me that?”\n\n“A pit full of fire.”\n\n“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for\never?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“What must you do to avoid it?”\n\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:\n“I must keep in good health, and not die.”\n\n“How can you keep in good health?\_ Children younger than you die daily.\_\nI buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a\ngood little child, whose soul is now in heaven.\_ It is to be feared the\nsame could not be said of you were you to be called hence.”\n\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down\non the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far\nenough away.\n\n“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having\nbeen the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.”\n\n“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed\nmy benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”\n\n“Do you say your prayers night and morning?” continued my interrogator.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Do you read your Bible?”\n\n“Sometimes.”\n\n“With pleasure?\_ Are you fond of it?”\n\n“I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and\na little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job\nand Jonah.”\n\n“And the Psalms?\_ I hope you like them?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“No? oh, shocking!\_ I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six\nPsalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a\ngingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the\nverse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a little\nangel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant\npiety.”\n\n“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.\n\n“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change\nit: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone\nand give you a heart of flesh.”\n\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that\noperation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed\ninterposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the\nconversation herself.\n\n“Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to\nyou three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character\nand disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I\nshould be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep\na strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a\ntendency to deceit.\_ I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may\nnot attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”\n\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her\nnature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however\ncarefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my\nefforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.\_\nNow, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I\ndimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new\nphase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I\ncould not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and\nunkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.\nBrocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to\nremedy the injury?\n\n“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and\nhastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\n\n“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it\nis akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake\nburning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.\nReed.\_ I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”\n\n“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,”\ncontinued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for\nthe vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at\nLowood.”\n\n“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr.\nBrocklehurst.\_ “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly\nappropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial\ncare shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.\_ I have studied\nhow best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only\nthe other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.\_ My second\ndaughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her\nreturn she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls\nat Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long\npinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they\nare almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked at\nmy dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.’”\n\n“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had\nI sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more\nexactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.\_ Consistency, my dear Mr.\nBrocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.”\n\n“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been\nobserved in every arrangement connected with the establishment of\nLowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy\nand active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its\ninhabitants.”\n\n“Quite right, sir.\_ I may then depend upon this child being received as\na pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position\nand prospects?”\n\n“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,\nand I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege\nof her election.”\n\n“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I\nassure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was\nbecoming too irksome.”\n\n“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.\_ I shall\nreturn to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good\nfriend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.\_ I shall\nsend Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there\nwill be no difficulty about receiving her.\_ Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,\nand to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.”\n\n“I will, madam.\_ Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s\nGuide,’ read it with prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account\nof the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to\nfalsehood and deceit.’”\n\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn\nin a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.\n\nMrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was\nsewing, I was watching her.\_ Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or\nseven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and\nstrong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a\nsomewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid;\nher brow was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose\nsufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid\nof ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her\nconstitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was an\nexact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under\nher control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed\nit to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to\nset off handsome attire.\n\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her\nfigure; I perused her features.\_ In my hand I held the tract containing\nthe sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been\npointed as to an appropriate warning.\_ What had just passed; what Mrs.\nReed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of\ntheir conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt\nevery word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of\nresentment fomented now within me.\n\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers\nat the same time suspended their nimble movements.\n\n“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate.\_ My look\nor something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with\nextreme though suppressed irritation.\_ I got up, I went to the door; I\ncame back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up\nto her.\n\nSpeak I must: I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but\nhow?\_ What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?\_ I\ngathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—\n\n“I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare\nI do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world\nexcept John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your\ngirl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.”\n\nMrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice\ncontinued to dwell freezingly on mine.\n\n“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in the tone in which a\nperson might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily\nused to a child.\n\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.\_ Shaking\nfrom head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—\n\n“I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again\nas long as I live.\_ I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and\nif any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say\nthe very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with\nmiserable cruelty.”\n\n“How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”\n\n“How dare I, Mrs. Reed?\_ How dare I?\_ Because it is the truth.\_ You\nthink I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or\nkindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.\_ I shall remember\nhow you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the\nred-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in\nagony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have\nmercy!\_ Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’\_ And that punishment you made me suffer\nbecause your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing.\_ I will\ntell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale.\_ People think you a\ngood woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted.\_ You are deceitful!”\n\n\n\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with\nthe strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.\_ It seemed as\nif an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into\nunhoped-for liberty.\_ Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed\nlooked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting\nup her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as\nif she would cry.\n\n“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?\_ Why do you\ntremble so violently?\_ Would you like to drink some water?”\n\n“No, Mrs. Reed.”\n\n“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?\_ I assure you, I desire to\nbe your friend.”\n\n“Not you.\_ You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful\ndisposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and\nwhat you have done.”\n\n“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected for\ntheir faults.”\n\n“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.\n\n“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to\nthe nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”\n\n“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.\nReed, for I hate to live here.”\n\n“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed sotto\nvoce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\n\nI was left there alone—winner of the field.\_ It was the hardest battle I\nhad fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the\nrug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s\nsolitude.\_ First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce\npleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my\npulses.\_ A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot\ngive its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,\nwithout experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of\nreaction.\_ A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would\nhave been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed:\nthe same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have\nrepresented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s\nsilence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the\ndreariness of my hated and hating position.\n\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine\nit seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and\ncorroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.\_ Willingly\nwould I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I knew, partly\nfrom experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her\nrepulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent\nimpulse of my nature.\n\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;\nfain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre\nindignation.\_ I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and\nendeavoured to read.\_ I could make no sense of the subject; my own\nthoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found\nfascinating.\_ I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the\nshrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or\nbreeze, through the grounds.\_ I covered my head and arms with the skirt\nof my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was\nquite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the\nfalling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept\nby past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.\_ I leaned against a\ngate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where\nthe short grass was nipped and blanched.\_ It was a very grey day; a most\nopaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes felt it\nintervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without\nmelting.\_ I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over\nand over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”\n\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you?\_ Come\nto lunch!”\n\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step\ncame tripping down the path.\n\n“You naughty little thing!” she said.\_ “Why don’t you come when you are\ncalled?”\n\nBessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been\nbrooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat\ncross.\_ The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,\nI was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger;\nand I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.\_ I just\nput my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”\n\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to\nindulge in: somehow it pleased her.\n\n“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at\nme; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I\nsuppose?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”\n\n“What does Bessie care for me?\_ She is always scolding me.”\n\n“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.\_ You should\nbe bolder.”\n\n“What! to get more knocks?”\n\n“Nonsense!\_ But you are rather put upon, that’s certain.\_ My mother\nsaid, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a\nlittle one of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some\ngood news for you.”\n\n“I don’t think you have, Bessie.”\n\n“Child! what do you mean?\_ What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!\_ Well, but\nMissis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this\nafternoon, and you shall have tea with me.\_ I’ll ask cook to bake you a\nlittle cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I\nam soon to pack your trunk.\_ Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a\nday or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.”\n\n“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.”\n\n“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid of\nme.\_ Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so\nprovoking.”\n\n“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I\nhave got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to\ndread.”\n\n“If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”\n\n“As you do, Bessie?”\n\n“I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the\nothers.”\n\n“You don’t show it.”\n\n“You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talking.\_ What\nmakes you so venturesome and hardy?”\n\n“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say\nsomething about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second\nthoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\n\n“And so you’re glad to leave me?”\n\n“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”\n\n“Just now! and rather!\_ How coolly my little lady says it!\_ I dare say\nnow if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say\nyou’d rather not.”\n\n“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.”\_ Bessie stooped; we\nmutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.\_\nThat afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie\ntold me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her\nsweetest songs.\_ Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.\n"
