title: "\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMerry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how\ndifferent from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and\nsolitude I had passed beneath its roof!\_ All sad feelings seemed now\ndriven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life\neverywhere, movement all day long.\_ You could not now traverse the\ngallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so\ntenantless, without encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet.\n\nThe kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall, the entrance hall,\nwere equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when\nthe blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called\ntheir occupants out into the grounds.\_ Even when that weather was\nbroken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast\nover enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in\nconsequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.\n\nI wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of\nentertainment was proposed: they spoke of “playing charades,” but in my\nignorance I did not understand the term.\_ The servants were called in,\nthe dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the\nchairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.\_ While Mr. Rochester\nand the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were\nrunning up and down stairs ringing for their maids.\_ Mrs. Fairfax was\nsummoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in\nshawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the\nthird storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of\nbrocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace\nlappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a\nselection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the\nboudoir within the drawing-room.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was\nselecting certain of their number to be of his party.\_ “Miss Ingram is\nmine, of course,” said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton,\nand Mrs. Dent.\_ He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had\nbeen fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent’s bracelet, which had got loose.\n\n“Will you play?” he asked.\_ I shook my head.\_ He did not insist, which I\nrather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my\nusual seat.\n\nHe and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which\nwas headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.\_ One of\nthe gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should\nbe asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.\n\n“No,” I heard her say: “she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.”\n\nEre long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.\_ Within the arch, the\nbulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,\nwas seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a\nlarge book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester’s\ncloak, and holding a book in her hand.\_ Somebody, unseen, rang the bell\nmerrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her guardian’s\nparty), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket\nof flowers she carried on her arm.\_ Then appeared the magnificent figure\nof Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of\nroses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together\nthey drew near the table.\_ They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa\nEshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.\_ A\nceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the\npantomime of a marriage.\_ At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party\nconsulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out—\n\n“Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\n\nA considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.\_ Its second rising\ndisplayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.\_ The\ndrawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the\ndining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back\nwithin the room, appeared a large marble basin—which I recognised as an\nornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded by\nexotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been\ntransported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\n\nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,\ncostumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.\_ His dark eyes and\nswarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked\nthe very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the\nbowstring.\_ Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.\_ She, too, was\nattired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the\nwaist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her\nbeautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\nsupporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.\_ Both her cast of\nform and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea\nof some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was\ndoubtless the character she intended to represent.\n\nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;\nshe again lifted it to her head.\_ The personage on the well-brink now\nseemed to accost her; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her\npitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.”\_ From the bosom of his robe\nhe then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets\nand earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid\nthe treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her\nlooks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and\nthe rings in her ears.\_ It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were\nwanting.\n\nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they\ncould not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.\_\nColonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;”\nwhereupon the curtain again descended.\n\nOn its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;\nthe rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and\ncoarse drapery.\_ The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a\ndeal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim\nlight proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all\nextinguished.\n\nAmidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on\nhis knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.\_ I knew Mr. Rochester;\nthough the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose\nfrom one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle),\nthe desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might\nwell have disguised him.\_ As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists\nwere attached fetters.\n\n“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.\n\nA sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their\nordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.\_ Mr. Rochester led in\nMiss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\n\n“Do you know,” said she, “that, of the three characters, I liked you in\nthe last best?\_ Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a\ngallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!”\n\n“Is all the soot washed from my face?” he asked, turning it towards her.\n\n“Alas! yes: the more’s the pity!\_ Nothing could be more becoming to your\ncomplexion than that ruffian’s rouge.”\n\n“You would like a hero of the road then?”\n\n“An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian\nbandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.”\n\n“Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour\nsince, in the presence of all these witnesses.”\_ She giggled, and her\ncolour rose.\n\n“Now, Dent,” continued Mr. Rochester, “it is your turn.”\_ And as the\nother party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.\_ Miss\nIngram placed herself at her leader’s right hand; the other diviners\nfilled the chairs on each side of him and her.\_ I did not now watch the\nactors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my\nattention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the\narch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.\_ What\ncharade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how\nthey acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the\nconsultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss\nIngram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,\ntill the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his\ncheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged\nglances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle\nreturns in memory at this moment.\n\nI have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I\ncould not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to\nnotice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never\nonce turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his attentions\nappropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of\nher robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on\nme by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to\nmerit observation.\_ I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would\nsoon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a proud security\nin his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed hourly in him a\nstyle of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought\nthan to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its\nvery pride, irresistible.\n\nThere was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though\nmuch to create despair.\_ Much too, you will think, reader, to engender\njealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a\nwoman in Miss Ingram’s.\_ But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the\nnature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.\_ Miss\nIngram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the\nfeeling.\_ Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.\_ She was very\nshowy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant\nattainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing\nbloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted\nby its freshness.\_ She was not good; she was not original: she used to\nrepeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an\nopinion of her own.\_ She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did\nnot know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were\nnot in her.\_ Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to\na spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing her\naway with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;\nsometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with\ncoldness and acrimony.\_ Other eyes besides mine watched these\nmanifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.\_\nYes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his\nintended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this\nguardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s\ndefects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her,\nthat my ever-torturing pain arose.\n\nI saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,\nbecause her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her\nhis love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him\nthat treasure.\_ This was the point—this was where the nerve was touched\nand teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: she could\nnot charm him.\n\nIf she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely\nlaid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the\nwall, and (figuratively) have died to them.\_ If Miss Ingram had been a\ngood and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I\nshould have had one vital struggle with two tigers—jealousy and despair:\nthen, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired\nher—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:\nand the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my\nadmiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence.\_ But as matters really\nstood, to watch Miss Ingram’s efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to\nwitness their repeated failure—herself unconscious that they did fail;\nvainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly\npluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled\nfurther and further what she wished to allure—to witness this, was\nto be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\n\nBecause, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.\_ Arrows\nthat continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester’s breast and fell\nharmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have\nquivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye,\nand softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a\nsilent conquest might have been won.\n\n“Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so\nnear to him?” I asked myself.\_ “Surely she cannot truly like him, or not\nlike him with true affection!\_ If she did, she need not coin her smiles\nso lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so\nelaborate, graces so multitudinous.\_ It seems to me that she might, by\nmerely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get\nnigher his heart.\_ I have seen in his face a far different expression\nfrom that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting\nhim; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious\narts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer\nwhat he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without\ngrimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one\nlike a fostering sunbeam.\_ How will she manage to please him when they\nare married?\_ I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be\nmanaged; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest\nwoman the sun shines on.”\n\nI have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester’s project of\nmarrying for interest and connections.\_ It surprised me when I first\ndiscovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely\nto be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but\nthe longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties,\nthe less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss\nIngram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into\nthem, doubtless, from their childhood.\_ All their class held these\nprinciples: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as\nI could not fathom.\_ It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him,\nI would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very\nobviousness of the advantages to the husband’s own happiness offered by\nthis plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general\nadoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the\nworld would act as I wished to act.\n\nBut in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my\nmaster: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a\nsharp look-out.\_ It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of\nhis character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing\nof both, to form an equitable judgment.\_ Now I saw no bad.\_ The sarcasm\nthat had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only\nlike keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but\ntheir absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.\_ And as for the\nvague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a\ndesponding expression?—that opened upon a careful observer, now and\nthen, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange\ndepth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and\nshrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and\nhad suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,\nat intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with\npalsied nerves.\_ Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare—to\ndivine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might\nlook into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse\ntheir nature.\n\nMeantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride—saw\nonly them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their\nmovements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with their\nown separate interests and pleasures.\_ The Ladies Lynn and Ingram\ncontinued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two\nturbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting\ngestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on\nwhich their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.\_ Mild Mrs.\nDent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes\nbestowed a courteous word or smile on me.\_ Sir George Lynn, Colonel\nDent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice\nbusiness.\_ Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang\nto and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly\nto the gallant speeches of the other.\_ Sometimes all, as with one\nconsent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal\nactors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected with\nhim—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party.\_ If he was absent\nfrom the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the\nspirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh\nimpulse to the vivacity of conversation.\n\nThe want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one\nday that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not\nlikely to return till late.\_ The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had\nproposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond\nHay, was consequently deferred.\_ Some of the gentlemen were gone to the\nstables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were\nplaying billiards in the billiard-room.\_ The dowagers Ingram and Lynn\nsought solace in a quiet game at cards.\_ Blanche Ingram, after having\nrepelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and\nMrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some\nsentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a\nnovel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a\nsofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious\nhours of absence.\_ The room and the house were silent: only now and then\nthe merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.\n\nIt was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the\nhour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the\ndrawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—\n\n“Voilà, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!”\n\nI turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others,\ntoo, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a\ncrunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible\non the wet gravel.\_ A post-chaise was approaching.\n\n“What can possess him to come home in that style?” said Miss Ingram.\_\n“He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and\nPilot was with him:—what has he done with the animals?”\n\nAs she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so\nnear the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking\nof my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when\nshe did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.\_ The\npost-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman\nalighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it\nwas a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\n\n“How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram: “you tiresome monkey!”\n(apostrophising Adèle), “who perched you up in the window to give false\nintelligence?” and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in\nfault.\n\nSome parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.\_\nHe bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\n\n“It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,” said he, “when my\nfriend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long\njourney, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate\nacquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.”\n\nHis manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being\nsomewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether\nEnglish: his age might be about Mr. Rochester’s,—between thirty and\nforty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a\nfine-looking man, at first sight especially.\_ On closer examination, you\ndetected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to\nplease.\_ His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large\nand well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life—at\nleast so I thought.\n\nThe sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.\_ It was not till\nafter dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.\_\nBut I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being\nat the same time unsettled and inanimate.\_ His eye wandered, and had no\nmeaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never\nremembered to have seen.\_ For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking\nman, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that\nsmooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline\nnose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even\nforehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\n\nAs I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the\ngirandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an\narm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as\nif he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.\_ I think (with\ndeference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a\nsleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the\nrough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\n\nHe had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.\_ A curious friendship\ntheirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage\nthat “extremes meet.”\n\nTwo or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps\nof their conversation across the room.\_ At first I could not make much\nsense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary\nIngram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that\nreached me at intervals.\_ These last were discussing the stranger; they\nboth called him “a beautiful man.”\_ Louisa said he was “a love of a\ncreature,” and she “adored him;” and Mary instanced his “pretty little\nmouth, and nice nose,” as her ideal of the charming.\n\n“And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa,—“so\nsmooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such\na placid eye and smile!”\n\nAnd then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other\nside of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to\nHay Common.\n\nI was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and\nI presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I\nlearned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from\nsome hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so\nsallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the\nhouse.\_ Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated\nthe West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I\ngathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted\nwith Mr. Rochester.\_ He spoke of his friend’s dislike of the burning\nheats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.\_ I knew Mr.\nRochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought\nthe continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never\nheard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.\n\nI was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat\nunexpected one, broke the thread of my musings.\_ Mr. Mason, shivering as\nsome one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the\nfire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still\nshone hot and red.\_ The footman who brought the coal, in going out,\nstopped near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to him in a low\nvoice, of which I heard only the words, “old woman,”—“quite\ntroublesome.”\n\n“Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself\noff,” replied the magistrate.\n\n“No—stop!” interrupted Colonel Dent.\_ “Don’t send her away, Eshton; we\nmight turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.”\_ And\nspeaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common\nto visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother\nBunches is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon being\nbrought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell them their fortunes.\_ Would you\nlike to see her?”\n\n“Surely, colonel,” cried Lady Ingram, “you would not encourage such a\nlow impostor?\_ Dismiss her, by all means, at once!”\n\n“But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,” said the footman; “nor\ncan any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating\nher to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and\nsays nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in\nhere.”\n\n“What does she want?” asked Mrs. Eshton.\n\n“‘To tell the gentry their fortunes,’ she says, ma’am; and she swears\nshe must and will do it.”\n\n“What is she like?” inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.\n\n“A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.”\n\n“Why, she’s a real sorceress!” cried Frederick Lynn.\_ “Let us have her\nin, of course.”\n\n“To be sure,” rejoined his brother; “it would be a thousand pities to\nthrow away such a chance of fun.”\n\n“My dear boys, what are you thinking about?” exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.\n\n“I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,” chimed\nin the Dowager Ingram.\n\n“Indeed, mama, but you can—and will,” pronounced the haughty voice of\nBlanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had\nsat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.\_ “I have a\ncuriosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame\nforward.”\n\n“My darling Blanche! recollect—”\n\n“I do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will—quick,\nSam!”\n\n“Yes—yes—yes!” cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.\_ “Let\nher come—it will be excellent sport!”\n\nThe footman still lingered.\_ “She looks such a rough one,” said he.\n\n“Go!” ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.\n\nExcitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery\nand jests was proceeding when Sam returned.\n\n“She won’t come now,” said he.\_ “She says it’s not her mission to appear\nbefore the ‘vulgar herd’ (them’s her words).\_ I must show her into a\nroom by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her\none by one.”\n\n“You see now, my queenly Blanche,” began Lady Ingram, “she encroaches.\_\nBe advised, my angel girl—and—”\n\n“Show her into the library, of course,” cut in the “angel girl.”\_ “It is\nnot my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to\nhave her all to myself.\_ Is there a fire in the library?”\n\n“Yes, ma’am—but she looks such a tinkler.”\n\n“Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.”\n\nAgain Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full\nflow once more.\n\n“She’s ready now,” said the footman, as he reappeared.\_ “She wishes to\nknow who will be her first visitor.”\n\n“I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies\ngo,” said Colonel Dent.\n\n“Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.”\n\nSam went and returned.\n\n“She says, sir, that she’ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble\nthemselves to come near her; nor,” he added, with difficulty suppressing\na titter, “any ladies either, except the young, and single.”\n\n“By Jove, she has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn.\n\nMiss Ingram rose solemnly: “I go first,” she said, in a tone which might\nhave befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van\nof his men.\n\n“Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!” was her mama’s cry; but\nshe swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which\nColonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.\n\nA comparative silence ensued.\_ Lady Ingram thought it “le cas” to wring\nher hands: which she did accordingly.\_ Miss Mary declared she felt, for\nher part, she never dared venture.\_ Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under\ntheir breath, and looked a little frightened.\n\nThe minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the\nlibrary-door again opened.\_ Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.\n\nWould she laugh?\_ Would she take it as a joke?\_ All eyes met her with a\nglance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and\ncoldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to\nher seat, and took it in silence.\n\n“Well, Blanche?” said Lord Ingram.\n\n“What did she say, sister?” asked Mary.\n\n“What did you think?\_ How do you feel?—Is she a real fortune-teller?”\ndemanded the Misses Eshton.\n\n“Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon me.\_\nReally your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,\nby the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to this\nmatter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who\nis in close alliance with the old gentleman.\_ I have seen a gipsy\nvagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of\npalmistry and told me what such people usually tell.\_ My whim is\ngratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the\nstocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.”\n\nMiss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined\nfurther conversation.\_ I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all\nthat time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker,\nmore dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.\_ She\nhad obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me,\nfrom her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,\nnotwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to\nwhatever revelations had been made her.\n\n\n\nMeantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go\nalone; and yet they all wished to go.\_ A negotiation was opened through\nthe medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,\ntill, I think, the said Sam’s calves must have ached with the exercise,\npermission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the\nrigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.\n\nTheir visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard\nhysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and\nat the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came\nrunning across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.\n\n“I am sure she is something not right!” they cried, one and all.\_ “She\ntold us such things!\_ She knows all about us!” and they sank breathless\ninto the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.\n\nPressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of\nthings they had said and done when they were mere children; described\nbooks and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that\ndifferent relations had presented to them.\_ They affirmed that she had\neven divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the\nname of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of\nwhat they most wished for.\n\nHere the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further\nenlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,\nejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.\_\nThe matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again\nand again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning\nhad not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the\nyounger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.\n\nIn the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully\nengaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I\nturned, and saw Sam.\n\n“If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young\nsingle lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she\nwill not go till she has seen all.\_ I thought it must be you: there is\nno one else for it.\_ What shall I tell her?”\n\n“Oh, I will go by all means,” I answered: and I was glad of the\nunexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.\_ I slipped\nout of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in\none mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door\nquietly behind me.\n\n“If you like, miss,” said Sam, “I’ll wait in the hall for you; and if\nshe frightens you, just call and I’ll come in.”\n\n“No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.”\_ Nor was\nI; but I was a good deal interested and excited.\n"
