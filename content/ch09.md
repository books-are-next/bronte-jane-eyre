title: "\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nMy first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;\nit comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself\nto new rules and unwonted tasks.\_ The fear of failure in these points\nharassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these\nwere no trifles.\n\nDuring January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after\ntheir melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring\nbeyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits\nwe had to pass an hour every day in the open air.\_ Our clothing was\ninsufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the\nsnow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became\nnumbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well\nthe distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when\nmy feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and\nstiff toes into my shoes in the morning.\_ Then the scanty supply of food\nwas distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had\nscarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.\_ From this\ndeficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the\nyounger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity,\nthey would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.\_ Many a\ntime I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown\nbread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half\nthe contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an\naccompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.\n\nSundays were dreary days in that wintry season.\_ We had to walk two\nmiles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.\_ We set out\ncold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became\nalmost paralysed.\_ It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance\nof cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our\nordinary meals, was served round between the services.\n\nAt the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and\nhilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy\nsummits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.\n\nI can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our\ndrooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,\ngathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to\nkeep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, “like stalwart\nsoldiers.”\_ The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves\ntoo much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.\n\nHow we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got\nback!\_ But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in\nthe schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great\ngirls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping\ntheir starved arms in their pinafores.\n\nA little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of\nbread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of a\nthin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all\nlooked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.\_ I generally contrived to\nreserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder\nI was invariably obliged to part with.\n\nThe Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church\nCatechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew;\nand in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose\nirrepressible yawns attested her weariness.\_ A frequent interlude of\nthese performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some\nhalf-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall\ndown, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be\ntaken up half dead.\_ The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the\ncentre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon\nwas finished.\_ Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together\nin a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors’ high stools.\n\nI have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed\nthat gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month\nafter my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the\narchdeacon: his absence was a relief to me.\_ I need not say that I had\nmy own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.\n\nOne afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting\nwith a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,\nraised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just\npassing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,\ntwo minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse,\nit was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose\nentrance they thus greeted.\_ A long stride measured the schoolroom, and\npresently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same\nblack column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of\nGateshead.\_ I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.\_ Yes,\nI was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and\nlooking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.\n\nI had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I\nremembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,\n&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and\nthe teachers of my vicious nature.\_ All along I had been dreading the\nfulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily for the “Coming\nMan,” whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to\nbrand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.\n\nHe stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did\nnot doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her\neye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb\nturn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt.\_ I listened too; and as\nI happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of\nwhat he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.\n\n“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it\nstruck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises,\nand I sorted the needles to match.\_ You may tell Miss Smith that I\nforgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have\nsome papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give\nout more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are\napt to be careless and lose them.\_ And, O ma’am!\_ I wish the woollen\nstockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the\nkitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a\nquantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of\nthe holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to\ntime.”\n\nHe paused.\n\n“Your directions shall be attended to, sir,” said Miss Temple.\n\n“And, ma’am,” he continued, “the laundress tells me some of the girls\nhave two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them\nto one.”\n\n“I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.\_ Agnes and Catherine\nJohnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last\nThursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the\noccasion.”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst nodded.\n\n“Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance\noccur too often.\_ And there is another thing which surprised me; I find,\nin settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of\nbread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past\nfortnight.\_ How is this?\_ I looked over the regulations, and I find no\nsuch meal as lunch mentioned.\_ Who introduced this innovation? and by\nwhat authority?”\n\n“I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,” replied Miss Temple:\n“the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly\neat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.”\n\n“Madam, allow me an instant.\_ You are aware that my plan in bringing up\nthese girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,\nbut to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.\_ Should any little\naccidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of\na meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not\nto be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort\nlost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;\nit ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by\nencouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.\_ A brief\naddress on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious\ninstructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of\nthe primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the\nexhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to\ntake up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not\nlive by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth\nof God; to His divine consolations, “If ye suffer hunger or thirst for\nMy sake, happy are ye.”\_ Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese,\ninstead of burnt porridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed\nfeed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their\nimmortal souls!”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings.\_ Miss\nTemple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now\ngazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,\nappeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;\nespecially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s\nchisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified\nseverity.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind\nhis back, majestically surveyed the whole school.\_ Suddenly his eye gave\na blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its\npupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used—\n\n“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—what is that girl with curled hair?\_\nRed hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?”\_ And extending his cane he\npointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\n\n“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\n\n“Julia Severn, ma’am!\_ And why has she, or any other, curled hair?\_ Why,\nin defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she\nconform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable\nestablishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?”\n\n“Julia’s hair curls naturally,” returned Miss Temple, still more\nquietly.\n\n“Naturally!\_ Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these\ngirls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?\_ I have again\nand again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely,\nmodestly, plainly.\_ Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off\nentirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far\ntoo much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round.\_\nTell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.”\n\nMiss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away\nthe involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and\nwhen the first class could take in what was required of them, they\nobeyed.\_ Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and\ngrimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.\nBrocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,\nwhatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside\nwas further beyond his interference than he imagined.\n\nHe scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes,\nthen pronounced sentence.\_ These words fell like the knell of doom—\n\n“All those top-knots must be cut off.”\n\nMiss Temple seemed to remonstrate.\n\n“Madam,” he pursued, “I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of\nthis world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the\nflesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and\nsobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the\nyoung persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which\nvanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think\nof the time wasted, of—”\n\nMr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now\nentered the room.\_ They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard\nhis lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,\nand furs.\_ The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and\nseventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich\nplumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a\nprofusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was\nenveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a\nfalse front of French curls.\n\nThese ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the\nMisses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the\nroom.\_ It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend\nrelative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room\nupstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned\nthe laundress, and lectured the superintendent.\_ They now proceeded to\naddress divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with\nthe care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had\nno time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and\nenchanted my attention.\n\nHitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss\nTemple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my\npersonal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only\nelude observation.\_ To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and\nwhile seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner\nas to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my\ntreacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling\nwith an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was\nall over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I\nrallied my forces for the worst.\_ It came.\n\n“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—“It is\nthe new pupil, I perceive.”\_ And before I could draw breath, “I must not\nforget I have a word to say respecting her.”\_ Then aloud: how loud it\nseemed to me!\_ “Let the child who broke her slate come forward!”\n\nOf my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two\ngreat girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me\ntowards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his\nvery feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—\n\n“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be\npunished.”\n\nThe kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\n\n“Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,” thought I;\nand an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my\npulses at the conviction.\_ I was no Helen Burns.\n\n“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one\nfrom which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\n\n“Place the child upon it.”\n\nAnd I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in no condition to\nnote particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the\nheight of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and\nthat a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of\nsilvery plumage extended and waved below me.\n\nMr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\n\n“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and\nchildren, you all see this girl?”\n\nOf course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses\nagainst my scorched skin.\n\n“You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form\nof childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given\nto all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.\_\nWho would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent\nin her?\_ Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.”\n\nA pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel\nthat the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be\nshirked, must be firmly sustained.\n\n“My dear children,” pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,\n“this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn\nyou, that this girl, who might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little\ncastaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper\nand an alien.\_ You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her\nexample; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,\nand shut her out from your converse.\_ Teachers, you must watch her: keep\nyour eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her\nactions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be\npossible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child,\nthe native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who\nsays its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl is—a\nliar!”\n\nNow came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect\npossession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce\ntheir pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the\nelderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones\nwhispered, “How shocking!”\_ Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.\n\n“This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable\nlady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own\ndaughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid\nby an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent\npatroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful\nlest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent\nher here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to\nthe troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of\nyou not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.”\n\nWith this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button\nof his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to\nMiss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the\nroom.\_ Turning at the door, my judge said—\n\n“Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak\nto her during the remainder of the day.”\n\nThere was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the\nshame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now\nexposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.\_ What my sensations\nwere no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my\nbreath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in\npassing, she lifted her eyes.\_ What a strange light inspired them!\_ What\nan extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!\_ How the new\nfeeling bore me up!\_ It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave\nor victim, and imparted strength in the transit.\_ I mastered the rising\nhysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.\_ Helen\nBurns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was\nchidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and\nsmiled at me as she again went by.\_ What a smile!\_ I remember it now,\nand I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage;\nit lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye,\nlike a reflection from the aspect of an angel.\_ Yet at that moment Helen\nBurns wore on her arm “the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago I had\nheard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on\nthe morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out.\_ Such\nis the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the\nclearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only see those\nminute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.\n"
