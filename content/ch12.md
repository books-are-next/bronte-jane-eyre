title: "\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nHitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant\nexistence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many\nchapters.\_ But this is not to be a regular autobiography.\_ I am only\nbound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some\ndegree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost\nin silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of\nconnection.\n\nWhen the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at\nLowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence\nand the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.\_\nInquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various\nfacts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.\_ The\nunhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children’s\nfood; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils’\nwretched clothing and accommodations—all these things were discovered,\nand the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but\nbeneficial to the institution.\n\nSeveral wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed\nlargely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better\nsituation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing\nintroduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of\na committee.\_ Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family\nconnections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of\ntreasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen\nof rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,\ntoo, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,\ncomfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.\_ The school, thus\nimproved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.\_ I\nremained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight\nyears: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear\nmy testimony to its value and importance.\n\nDuring these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because\nit was not inactive.\_ I had the means of an excellent education placed\nwithin my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to\nexcel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers,\nespecially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the\nadvantages offered me.\_ In time I rose to be the first girl of the first\nclass; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I\ndischarged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I\naltered.\n\nMiss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent\nof the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my\nacquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;\nshe had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,\ncompanion.\_ At this period she married, removed with her husband (a\nclergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant\ncounty, and consequently was lost to me.\n\nFrom the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every\nsettled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a\nhome to me.\_ I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of\nher habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated\nfeelings had become the inmates of my mind.\_ I had given in allegiance\nto duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of\nothers, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued\ncharacter.\n\nBut destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and\nMiss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,\nshortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill\nand disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and\nthere spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in\nhonour of the occasion.\n\nI walked about the chamber most of the time.\_ I imagined myself only to\nbe regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my\nreflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon\nwas gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,\nnamely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process;\nthat my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather\nthat she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing\nin her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and\nbeginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.\_ It did not seem as if a\nprop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the\npower to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for\ntranquillity was no more.\_ My world had for some years been in Lowood:\nmy experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that\nthe real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of\nsensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth\ninto its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.\n\nI went to my window, opened it, and looked out.\_ There were the two\nwings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of\nLowood; there was the hilly horizon.\_ My eye passed all other objects to\nrest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to\nsurmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed\nprison-ground, exile limits.\_ I traced the white road winding round the\nbase of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed\nto follow it farther!\_ I recalled the time when I had travelled that\nvery road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an\nage seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to\nLowood, and I had never quitted it since.\_ My vacations had all been\nspent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither\nshe nor any of her family had ever been to visit me.\_ I had had no\ncommunication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules,\nschool-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and\nphrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such was what I\nknew of existence.\_ And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of\nthe routine of eight years in one afternoon.\_ I desired liberty; for\nliberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on\nthe wind then faintly blowing.\_ I abandoned it and framed a humbler\nsupplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off\ninto vague space: “Then,” I cried, half desperate, “grant me at least a\nnew servitude!”\n\nHere a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\n\nI was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till\nbedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me\nfrom the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of\nsmall talk.\_ How I wished sleep would silence her.\_ It seemed as if,\ncould I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I\nstood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.\n\nMiss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her\nhabitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light\nthan as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with\nsatisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought\ninstantly revived.\n\n“A new servitude!\_ There is something in that,” I soliloquised\n(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud), “I know there is,\nbecause it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as\nLiberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more\nthan sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of\ntime to listen to them.\_ But Servitude!\_ That must be matter of fact.\_\nAny one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to\nserve elsewhere.\_ Can I not get so much of my own will?\_ Is not the\nthing feasible?\_ Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a\nbrain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.”\n\nI sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly\nnight; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to\nthink again with all my might.\n\n“What do I want?\_ A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under\nnew circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything\nbetter.\_ How do people do to get a new place?\_ They apply to friends, I\nsuppose: I have no friends.\_ There are many others who have no friends,\nwho must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is\ntheir resource?”\n\nI could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a\nresponse, and quickly.\_ It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses\nthrob in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;\nand no result came of its efforts.\_ Feverish with vain labour, I got up\nand took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,\nshivered with cold, and again crept to bed.\n\nA kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion\non my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my\nmind.—“Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the\n---shire Herald.”\n\n“How?\_ I know nothing about advertising.”\n\nReplies rose smooth and prompt now:—\n\n“You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a\ncover directed to the editor of the Herald; you must put it, the\nfirst opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be\naddressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in\nabout a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act\naccordingly.”\n\nThis scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind;\nI had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.\n\nWith earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,\nand directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:—\n\n“A young lady accustomed to tuition” (had I not been a teacher two\nyears?) “is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family\nwhere the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely\neighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my\nown age).\_ She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good\nEnglish education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in those\ndays, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have\nbeen held tolerably comprehensive).\_ “Address, J.E., Post-office,\nLowton, ---shire.”\n\nThis document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked\nleave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform\nsome small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;\npermission was readily granted; I went.\_ It was a walk of two miles, and\nthe evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or\ntwo, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through\nheavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.\n\nThe succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however,\nlike all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a\npleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.\_ A\npicturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck\nand through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more\nof the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little\nburgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.\n\nMy ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of\nshoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I\nstepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker’s to\nthe post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on\nher nose, and black mittens on her hands.\n\n“Are there any letters for J.E.?” I asked.\n\nShe peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and\nfumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began\nto falter.\_ At last, having held a document before her glasses for\nnearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying\nthe act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E.\n\n“Is there only one?” I demanded.\n\n“There are no more,” said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my\nface homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by\neight, and it was already half-past seven.\n\nVarious duties awaited me on my arrival.\_ I had to sit with the girls\nduring their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see\nthem to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.\_ Even when we\nfinally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my\ncompanion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I\ndreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,\nhowever, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she\nwas already snoring before I had finished undressing.\_ There still\nremained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an\ninitial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.\n\n“If J.E., who advertised in the ---shire Herald of last Thursday,\npossesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to\ngive satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation\ncan be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under\nten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.\_ J.E.\nis requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to\nthe direction:—\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire.”\n\nI examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather\nuncertain, like that of an elderly lady.\_ This circumstance was\nsatisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for\nmyself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some\nscrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to\nbe respectable, proper, en règle.\_ I now felt that an elderly lady\nwas no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.\_ Mrs. Fairfax!\_ I\nsaw her in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not\nuncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.\_ Thornfield! that,\ndoubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure;\nthough I failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the\npremises.\_ Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map\nof England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.\_ ---shire was\nseventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided:\nthat was a recommendation to me.\_ I longed to go where there was life\nand movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of\nthe A-; a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be\na complete change at least.\_ Not that my fancy was much captivated by\nthe idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” I argued,\n“Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town.”\n\nHere the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.\n\nNext day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be\nconfined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their\nsuccess.\_ Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent\nduring the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a\nnew situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for\nat Lowood I only got £15 per annum); and requested she would break the\nmatter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and\nascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.\_\nShe obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.\_ The next\nday she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed\nmust be written to, as she was my natural guardian.\_ A note was\naccordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that “I\nmight do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my\naffairs.”\_ This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after\nwhat appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to\nbetter my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had\nalways conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a\ntestimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that\ninstitution, should forthwith be furnished me.\n\nThis testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a\ncopy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she\nwas satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my\nassuming the post of governess in her house.\n\nI now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.\_ I\nhad not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and\nthe last day sufficed to pack my trunk,—the same I had brought with me\neight years ago from Gateshead.\n\nThe box was corded, the card nailed on.\_ In half-an-hour the carrier was\nto call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at\nan early hour the next morning to meet the coach.\_ I had brushed my\nblack stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff;\nsought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now\nhaving nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.\_ I could not;\nthough I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I\nwas too much excited.\_ A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new\none opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must\nwatch feverishly while the change was being accomplished.\n\n“Miss,” said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering\nlike a troubled spirit, “a person below wishes to see you.”\n\n“The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.\_\nI was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of\nwhich was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—\n\n“It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!” cried the\nindividual who stopped my progress and took my hand.\n\nI looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,\nyet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively\ncomplexion.\n\n“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half\nrecognised; “you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?”\n\nIn another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “Bessie!\_\nBessie!\_ Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half\ncried, and we both went into the parlour.\_ By the fire stood a little\nfellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.\n\n“That is my little boy,” said Bessie directly.\n\n“Then you are married, Bessie?”\n\n“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I’ve a\nlittle girl besides Bobby there, that I’ve christened Jane.”\n\n“And you don’t live at Gateshead?”\n\n“I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.”\n\n“Well, and how do they all get on?\_ Tell me everything about them,\nBessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will\nyou?” but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.\n\n“You’re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,” continued\nMrs. Leaven.\_ “I dare say they’ve not kept you too well at school: Miss\nReed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana\nwould make two of you in breadth.”\n\n“Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?”\n\n“Very.\_ She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there\neverybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his\nrelations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss\nGeorgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.\_\nIt was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now\nshe and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always\nquarrelling—”\n\n“Well, and what of John Reed?”\n\n“Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.\_ He went to\ncollege, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles\nwanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a\ndissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.”\n\n“What does he look like?”\n\n“He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he\nhas such thick lips.”\n\n“And Mrs. Reed?”\n\n“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not\nquite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please her—he spends\na deal of money.”\n\n“Did she send you here, Bessie?”\n\n“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that\nthere had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another\npart of the country, I thought I’d just set off, and get a look at you\nbefore you were quite out of my reach.”\n\n“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.”\_ I said this laughing:\nI perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no\nshape denote admiration.\n\n“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a\nlady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as\na child.”\n\nI smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I\nconfess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most\npeople wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior\nlikely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.\n\n“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued Bessie, by way of\nsolace.\_ “What can you do?\_ Can you play on the piano?”\n\n“A little.”\n\nThere was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me\nto sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was\ncharmed.\n\n“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she exultingly.\_ “I always\nsaid you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?”\n\n“That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.”\_ It was a\nlandscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the\nsuperintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the\ncommittee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.\n\n“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!\_ It is as fine a picture as any\nMiss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies\nthemselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?”\n\n“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.”\n\n“And you can work on muslin and canvas?”\n\n“I can.”\n\n“Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!\_ I knew you would be: you will get\non whether your relations notice you or not.\_ There was something I\nwanted to ask you.\_ Have you ever heard anything from your father’s\nkinsfolk, the Eyres?”\n\n“Never in my life.”\n\n“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:\nand they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds\nare; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead\nand wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off;\nhe seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a\nvoyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a\nday or two.\_ He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your\nfather’s brother.”\n\n“What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?”\n\n“An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did\ntell me—”\n\n“Madeira?” I suggested.\n\n“Yes, that is it—that is the very word.”\n\n“So he went?”\n\n“Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high\nwith him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’\_ My Robert\nbelieves he was a wine-merchant.”\n\n“Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a\nwine-merchant.”\n\nBessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was\nobliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning\nat Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.\_ We parted finally at the\ndoor of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set\noff for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take\nher back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new\nduties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.\n"
