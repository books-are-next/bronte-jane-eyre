title: "\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nI continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully\nas I could.\_ It was truly hard work at first.\_ Some time elapsed before,\nwith all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.\_\nWholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me\nhopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I\nwas mistaken.\_ There was a difference amongst them as amongst the\neducated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference\nrapidly developed itself.\_ Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,\nand ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\nrustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.\_ Many showed themselves\nobliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few\nexamples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of\nexcellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.\_ These\nsoon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons\nneat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly\nmanners.\_ The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even\nsurprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began\npersonally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.\_ I had\namongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown,\nalmost.\_ These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught\nthe elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\nneedlework.\_ I found estimable characters amongst them—characters\ndesirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed\nmany a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.\_ Their parents then\n(the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.\_ There was an\nenjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a\nconsideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were\nnot, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and\nbenefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it\nmade them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\n\nI felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.\_ Whenever I went out,\nI heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly\nsmiles.\_ To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of\nworking people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;” serene\ninward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.\_ At this period of my life,\nmy heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:\nand yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful\nexistence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,\nan evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I used to rush\ninto strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of\nthe ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,\ncharged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still\nagain and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and\nthen the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,\ntouching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of\npassing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first\nforce and fire.\_ Then I awoke.\_ Then I recalled where I was, and how\nsituated.\_ Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and\nquivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of\ndespair, and heard the burst of passion.\_ By nine o’clock the next\nmorning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared\nfor the steady duties of the day.\n\nRosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.\_ Her call at the\nschool was generally made in the course of her morning ride.\_ She would\ncanter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery\nservant.\_ Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple\nhabit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the\nlong curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can\nscarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic\nbuilding, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.\_\nShe generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his\ndaily catechising lesson.\_ Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress\npierce the young pastor’s heart.\_ A sort of instinct seemed to warn him\nof her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was looking\nquite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow,\nand his marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed\nindescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a\nrepressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could\nindicate.\n\nOf course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,\nconceal it from her.\_ In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went\nup and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in\nhis face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.\_ He seemed to say,\nwith his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I\nlove you, and I know you prefer me.\_ It is not despair of success that\nkeeps me dumb.\_ If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.\_\nBut that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged\nround it.\_ It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”\n\nAnd then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would\nsoften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from\nhis, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic\nand so martyr-like.\_ St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to\nfollow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not\ngive one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love,\none hope of the true, eternal Paradise.\_ Besides, he could not bind all\nthat he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the\npriest—in the limits of a single passion.\_ He could not—he would\nnot—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the\npeace of Vale Hall.\_ I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,\ndespite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.\n\nMiss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.\_ I\nhad learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:\nshe was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly\nselfish.\_ She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely\nspoilt.\_ She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,\nwhen every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),\nbut not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;\ningenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she\nwas very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like\nme; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.\_ A\nvery different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the\nsisters of St. John.\_ Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil\nAdèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a\ncloser affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive\nadult acquaintance.\n\nShe had taken an amiable caprice to me.\_ She said I was like Mr. Rivers,\nonly, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a\nnice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.”\_ I was, however,\ngood, clever, composed, and firm, like him.\_ I was a lusus naturæ,\nshe affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous\nhistory, if known, would make a delightful romance.\n\nOne evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless\nyet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and\nthe table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French\nbooks, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then\nmy drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a\npretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views\nfrom nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.\_\nShe was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with\ndelight.\n\n“Had I done these pictures?\_ Did I know French and German?\_ What a\nlove—what a miracle I was!\_ I drew better than her master in the first\nschool in S-.\_ Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”\n\n“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the\nidea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.\_ She had then on a\ndark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament\nwas her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the\nwild grace of natural curls.\_ I took a sheet of fine card-board, and\ndrew a careful outline.\_ I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it;\nand, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit\nanother day.\n\nShe made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself\naccompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and\ngrey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright\nflower near a hoary turret.\_ He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud\npersonage; but he was very kind to me.\_ The sketch of Rosamond’s\nportrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of\nit.\_ He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at\nVale Hall.\n\nI went.\_ I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant\nevidences of wealth in the proprietor.\_ Rosamond was full of glee and\npleasure all the time I stayed.\_ Her father was affable; and when he\nentered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong\nterms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he\nonly feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,\nand would soon quit it for one more suitable.\n\n“Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in a\nhigh family, papa.”\n\nI thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in\nthe land.\_ Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with\ngreat respect.\_ He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;\nthat the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once\nbelonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of that\nhouse might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best.\_ He accounted\nit a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the\ndesign of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable\nlife away.\_ It appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle\nin the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John.\_ Mr. Oliver evidently\nregarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and sacred\nprofession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.\n\nIt was the 5th of November, and a holiday.\_ My little servant, after\nhelping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a\npenny for her aid.\_ All about me was spotless and bright—scoured floor,\npolished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.\_ I had also made myself neat,\nand had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.\n\nThe translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my\npalette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier\noccupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature.\_ The head was\nfinished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery\nto shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft\ncurl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the\nlash under the azured eyelid.\_ I was absorbed in the execution of these\nnice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St.\nJohn Rivers.\n\n“I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said.\_ “Not, I\nhope, in thought?\_ No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel\nlonely.\_ You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up\nwonderfully so far.\_ I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and\nhe laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine\nproductions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those\ndays—the golden age of modern literature.\_ Alas! the readers of our era\nare less favoured.\_ But courage!\_ I will not pause either to accuse or\nrepine.\_ I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon\ngained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their\nexistence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.\_\nPowerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph,\nand feeble ones weep over their destruction.\_ Poetry destroyed?\_ Genius\nbanished?\_ No!\_ Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the\nthought.\_ No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without\ntheir divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell\nof your own meanness.\n\nWhile I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for\n“Marmion” it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.\_ His tall\nfigure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.\_ I looked up at\nhim: he shunned my eye.\_ I knew his thoughts well, and could read his\nheart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had\nthen temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to\ndo him some good, if I could.\n\n“With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself\ntoo far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses,\nimparts nothing.\_ I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about\nthis sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make\nhim talk.”\n\nI said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.”\_ But he answered, as he always\ndid, that he could not stay.\_ “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand\nif you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is\nat least as bad for you as it is for me.\_ I’ll try if I cannot discover\nthe secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that\nmarble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of\nsympathy.”\n\n“Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.\n\n“Like!\_ Like whom?\_ I did not observe it closely.”\n\n“You did, Mr. Rivers.”\n\nHe almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me\nastonished.\_ “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within.\_ “I don’t\nmean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to\ngo to considerable lengths.”\_ I continued, “You observed it closely and\ndistinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,” and I\nrose and placed it in his hand.\n\n“A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very\ngraceful and correct drawing.”\n\n“Yes, yes; I know all that.\_ But what of the resemblance?\_ Who is it\nlike?”\n\nMastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”\n\n“Of course.\_ And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will\npromise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very\npicture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.\_ I\ndon’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would\ndeem worthless.”\n\nHe continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he\nheld it, the more he seemed to covet it.\_ “It is like!” he murmured;\n“the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.\_\nIt smiles!”\n\n“Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?\_\nTell me that.\_ When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India,\nwould it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or\nwould the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and\ndistress?”\n\nHe now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,\ndisturbed: he again surveyed the picture.\n\n“That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious\nor wise is another question.”\n\nSince I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her\nfather was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my views\nthan St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate\ntheir union.\_ It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of\nMr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he\nwent and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under\na tropical sun.\_ With this persuasion I now answered—\n\n“As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were\nto take to yourself the original at once.”\n\nBy this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table\nbefore him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over\nit.\_ I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.\_ I\nsaw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed\nunapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt\nby him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief.\_ Reserved people often\nreally need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more\nthan the expansive.\_ The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and\nto “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the silent sea” of their\nsouls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.\n\n“She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and\nher father respects you.\_ Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather\nthoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and\nher.\_ You ought to marry her.”\n\n“Does she like me?” he asked.\n\n“Certainly; better than she likes any one else.\_ She talks of you\ncontinually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so\noften.”\n\n“It is very pleasant to hear this,” he said—“very: go on for another\nquarter of an hour.”\_ And he actually took out his watch and laid it\nupon the table to measure the time.\n\n“But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably\npreparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to\nfetter your heart?”\n\n“Don’t imagine such hard things.\_ Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am\ndoing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and\noverflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and\nwith such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good\nintentions, of self-denying plans.\_ And now it is deluged with a\nnectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering them:\nnow I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale\nHall at my bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: she is talking to me with her\nsweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has\ncopied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips.\_ She is mine—I am\nhers—this present life and passing world suffice to me.\_ Hush! say\nnothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the time\nI marked pass in peace.”\n\nI humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood\nsilent.\_ Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid\nthe picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.\n\n“Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion.\_\nI rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck\nvoluntarily under her yoke of flowers.\_ I tasted her cup.\_ The pillow\nwas burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter\ntaste: her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all\nthis.”\n\nI gazed at him in wonder.\n\n“It is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so\nwildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of\nwhich is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience at\nthe same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me\na good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should\ndiscover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’\nrapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.\_ This I know.”\n\n“Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.\n\n“While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her charms,\nsomething else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such\nthat she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate in nothing\nI undertook.\_ Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?\_\nRosamond a missionary’s wife?\_ No!”\n\n“But you need not be a missionary.\_ You might relinquish that scheme.”\n\n“Relinquish!\_ What! my vocation?\_ My great work?\_ My foundation laid on\nearth for a mansion in heaven?\_ My hopes of being numbered in the band\nwho have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their\nrace—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting\npeace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of\nheaven for the fear of hell?\_ Must I relinquish that?\_ It is dearer than\nthe blood in my veins.\_ It is what I have to look forward to, and to\nlive for.”\n\nAfter a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver?\_ Are her\ndisappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?”\n\n“Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than\na month, my image will be effaced from her heart.\_ She will forget me;\nand will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I\nshould do.”\n\n“You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.\_ You are\nwasting away.”\n\n“No.\_ If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet\nunsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated.\_ Only this morning,\nI received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so\nlong expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come\nyet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.”\n\n“You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the\nschoolroom.”\n\nAgain the surprised expression crossed his face.\_ He had not imagined\nthat a woman would dare to speak so to a man.\_ For me, I felt at home in\nthis sort of discourse.\_ I could never rest in communication with\nstrong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had\npassed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold\nof confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone.\n\n“You are original,” said he, “and not timid.\_ There is something brave\nin your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to\nassure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.\_ You think them\nmore profound and potent than they are.\_ You give me a larger allowance\nof sympathy than I have a just claim to.\_ When I colour, and when I\nshade before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.\_ I scorn the weakness.\_\nI know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the\nconvulsion of the soul.\_ That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in\nthe depths of a restless sea.\_ Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man.”\n\nI smiled incredulously.\n\n“You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it is\nmuch at your service.\_ I am simply, in my original state—stripped of\nthat blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human\ndeformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man.\_ Natural affection only, of all\nthe sentiments, has permanent power over me.\_ Reason, and not feeling,\nis my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do\nmore than others, insatiable.\_ I honour endurance, perseverance,\nindustry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great\nends and mount to lofty eminence.\_ I watch your career with interest,\nbecause I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic\nwoman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or\nwhat you still suffer.”\n\n“You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said.\n\n“No.\_ There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I\nbelieve; and I believe the Gospel.\_ You missed your epithet.\_ I am not a\npagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus.\_ As\nHis disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.\_ I\nadvocate them: I am sworn to spread them.\_ Won in youth to religion, she\nhas cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ, natural\naffection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.\_ From\nthe wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense\nof the Divine justice.\_ Of the ambition to win power and renown for my\nwretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master’s\nkingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.\_ So much\nhas religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best\naccount; pruning and training nature.\_ But she could not eradicate\nnature: nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put on\nimmortality.’”\n\nHaving said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my\npalette.\_ Once more he looked at the portrait.\n\n“She is lovely,” he murmured.\_ “She is well named the Rose of the\nWorld, indeed!”\n\n“And may I not paint one like it for you?”\n\n“Cui bono?\_ No.”\n\nHe drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was\naccustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from\nbeing sullied.\_ What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was\nimpossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.\_ He took it\nup with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,\ninexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed\nto take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for\nit traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.\_ His lips parted, as if to\nspeak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.\n\n“What is the matter?” I asked.\n\n“Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw\nhim dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.\_ It disappeared in\nhis glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” he vanished.\n\n“Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps the\nglobe, however!”\n\nI, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few\ndingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.\_ I\npondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and\nbeing certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon\nforgot it.\n"
