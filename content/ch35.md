title: "\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nWhen Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm\ncontinued all night.\_ The next day a keen wind brought fresh and\nblinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost\nimpassable.\_ I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent\nthe snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting\nnearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the\ntempest, I lit a candle, took down “Marmion,” and beginning—\n\n“Day set on Norham’s castled steep,\n And Tweed’s fair river broad and deep,\n \_\_ And Cheviot’s mountains lone;\n The massive towers, the donjon keep,\n The flanking walls that round them sweep,\n \_\_ In yellow lustre shone”—\n\n\nI soon forgot storm in music.\n\nI heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.\_ No; it was St.\nJohn Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen\nhurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that\ncovered his tall figure all white as a glacier.\_ I was almost in\nconsternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up\nvale that night.\n\n“Any ill news?” I demanded.\_ “Has anything happened?”\n\n“No.\_ How very easily alarmed you are!” he answered, removing his cloak\nand hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed\nthe mat which his entrance had deranged.\_ He stamped the snow from his\nboots.\n\n“I shall sully the purity of your floor,” said he, “but you must excuse\nme for once.”\_ Then he approached the fire.\_ “I have had hard work to\nget here, I assure you,” he observed, as he warmed his hands over the\nflame.\_ “One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite\nsoft yet.”\n\n“But why are you come?” I could not forbear saying.\n\n“Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask\nit, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my\nmute books and empty rooms.\_ Besides, since yesterday I have experienced\nthe excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is\nimpatient to hear the sequel.”\n\nHe sat down.\_ I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I\nbegan to fear his wits were touched.\_ If he were insane, however, his\nwas a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that\nhandsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it\ndid just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and\nlet the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where\nit grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so\nplainly graved.\_ I waited, expecting he would say something I could at\nleast comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his\nlip: he was thinking.\_ It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his\nface.\_ A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was\nmoved to say—\n\n“I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that\nyou should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own\nhealth.”\n\n“Not at all,” said he: “I care for myself when necessary.\_ I am well\nnow.\_ What do you see amiss in me?”\n\nThis was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed\nthat my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.\_ I\nwas silenced.\n\nHe still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye\ndwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say\nsomething, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the\ndoor, which was behind him.\n\n“No, no!” he responded shortly and somewhat testily.\n\n“Well,” I reflected, “if you won’t talk, you may be still; I’ll let you\nalone now, and return to my book.”\n\nSo I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of “Marmion.”\_ He soon\nstirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a\nmorocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,\nfolded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.\_ It was vain to try to\nread with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in\nimpatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk\nI would.\n\n“Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?”\n\n“Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.”\n\n“There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?\_ You\nwill not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?”\n\n“I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.”\_ Baffled so\nfar, I changed my ground.\_ I bethought myself to talk about the school\nand my scholars.\n\n“Mary Garrett’s mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this\nmorning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry\nClose—they would have come to-day but for the snow.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“Mr. Oliver pays for two.”\n\n“Does he?”\n\n“He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Was it your suggestion?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Whose, then?”\n\n“His daughter’s, I think.”\n\n“It is like her: she is so good-natured.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAgain came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.\_ It\naroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.\n\n“Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,” he said.\n\nWondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.\n\n“Half-an-hour ago,” he pursued, “I spoke of my impatience to hear the\nsequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better\nmanaged by my assuming the narrator’s part, and converting you into a\nlistener.\_ Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story\nwill sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often\nregain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips.\_ For the\nrest, whether trite or novel, it is short.\n\n“Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this moment—fell\nin love with a rich man’s daughter; she fell in love with him, and\nmarried him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently\ndisowned her immediately after the wedding.\_ Before two years passed,\nthe rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one\nslab.\_ (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a\nhuge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an\novergrown manufacturing town in ---shire.)\_ They left a daughter, which,\nat its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as that of the\nsnow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.\_ Charity carried the\nfriendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was\nreared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of\nGateshead.\_ You start—did you hear a noise?\_ I daresay it is only a rat\nscrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn\nbefore I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by\nrats.—To proceed.\_ Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was\nhappy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the\nend of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no other\nthan Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.\_ It seems her\ncareer there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher,\nlike yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points in her\nhistory and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again, your\nfates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a\ncertain Mr. Rochester.”\n\n“Mr. Rivers!” I interrupted.\n\n“I can guess your feelings,” he said, “but restrain them for a while: I\nhave nearly finished; hear me to the end.\_ Of Mr. Rochester’s character\nI know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable\nmarriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered\nhe had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.\_ What his subsequent conduct\nand proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event\ntranspired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was\ndiscovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how.\_ She had\nleft Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had\nbeen vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of\ninformation could be gathered respecting her.\_ Yet that she should be\nfound is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been\nput in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr.\nBriggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.\_ Is\nit not an odd tale?”\n\n“Just tell me this,” said I, “and since you know so much, you surely can\ntell it me—what of Mr. Rochester?\_ How and where is he?\_ What is he\ndoing?\_ Is he well?”\n\n“I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never\nmentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have\nadverted to.\_ You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature\nof the event which requires her appearance.”\n\n“Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?\_ Did no one see Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“I suppose not.”\n\n“But they wrote to him?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“And what did he say?\_ Who has his letters?”\n\n“Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from\nMr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed ‘Alice Fairfax.’”\n\nI felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had\nin all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to\nsome former haunt on the Continent.\_ And what opiate for his severe\nsufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there?\_ I\ndared not answer the question.\_ Oh, my poor master—once almost my\nhusband—whom I had often called “my dear Edward!”\n\n“He must have been a bad man,” observed Mr. Rivers.\n\n“You don’t know him—don’t pronounce an opinion upon him,” I said, with\nwarmth.\n\n“Very well,” he answered quietly: “and indeed my head is otherwise\noccupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.\_ Since you won’t ask\nthe governess’s name, I must tell it of my own accord.\_ Stay!\_ I have it\nhere—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written\ndown, fairly committed to black and white.”\n\nAnd the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought\nthrough; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of\npaper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of\nultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the\nportrait-cover.\_ He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced\nin Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words “Jane Eyre”—the work\ndoubtless of some moment of abstraction.\n\n“Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:” he said, “the advertisements\ndemanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my\nsuspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once\nresolved into certainty.\_ You own the name and renounce the alias?”\n\n“Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?\_ He perhaps knows more of Mr.\nRochester than you do.”\n\n“Briggs is in London.\_ I should doubt his knowing anything at all about\nMr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.\_ Meantime,\nyou forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why\nMr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you.”\n\n“Well, what did he want?”\n\n“Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that\nhe has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely\nthat—nothing more.”\n\n“I!—rich?”\n\n“Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress.”\n\nSilence succeeded.\n\n“You must prove your identity of course,” resumed St. John presently: “a\nstep which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate\npossession.\_ Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the\nwill and the necessary documents.”\n\nHere was a new card turned up!\_ It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted\nin a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a matter\none can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.\_ And then there\nare other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this\nis solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its\nassociations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.\_\nOne does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got\na fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder\nbusiness; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and\nwe contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.\n\nBesides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,\nDeath, Funeral.\_ My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever\nsince being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one\nday seeing him: now, I never should.\_ And then this money came only to\nme: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.\_ It was a\ngrand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I felt\nthat—that thought swelled my heart.\n\n“You unbend your forehead at last,” said Mr. Rivers.\_ “I thought Medusa\nhad looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.\_ Perhaps now you\nwill ask how much you are worth?”\n\n“How much am I worth?”\n\n“Oh, a trifle!\_ Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I\nthink they say—but what is that?”\n\n“Twenty thousand pounds?”\n\nHere was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand.\_\nThis news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had\nnever heard laugh before, laughed now.\n\n“Well,” said he, “if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your\ncrime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.”\n\n“It is a large sum—don’t you think there is a mistake?”\n\n“No mistake at all.”\n\n“Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!”\n\n“It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand.”\n\nI again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical\npowers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for\na hundred.\_ Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.\n\n“If it were not such a very wild night,” he said, “I would send Hannah\ndown to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left\nalone.\_ But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as\nI: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e’en leave you to your\nsorrows.\_ Good-night.”\n\nHe was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.\_ “Stop one\nminute!” I cried.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he\nknew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way\nplace, had the power to aid in my discovery.”\n\n“Oh!\_ I am a clergyman,” he said; “and the clergy are often appealed to\nabout odd matters.”\_ Again the latch rattled.\n\n“No; that does not satisfy me!” I exclaimed: and indeed there was\nsomething in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of\nallaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.\n\n“It is a very strange piece of business,” I added; “I must know more\nabout it.”\n\n“Another time.”\n\n“No; to-night!—to-night!” and as he turned from the door, I placed\nmyself between it and him.\_ He looked rather embarrassed.\n\n“You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,” I said.\n\n“I would rather not just now.”\n\n“You shall!—you must!”\n\n“I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.”\n\nOf course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified\nit must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.\n\n“But I apprised you that I was a hard man,” said he, “difficult to\npersuade.”\n\n“And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off.”\n\n\n\n“And then,” he pursued, “I am cold: no fervour infects me.”\n\n“Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.\_ The blaze there has thawed\nall the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to\nmy floor, and made it like a trampled street.\_ As you hope ever to be\nforgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a\nsanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.”\n\n“Well, then,” he said, “I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your\nperseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.\_ Besides, you must\nknow some day,—as well now as later.\_ Your name is Jane Eyre?”\n\n“Of course: that was all settled before.”\n\n“You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was\nchristened St. John Eyre Rivers?”\n\n“No, indeed!\_ I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your\ninitials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I\nnever asked for what name it stood.\_ But what then?\_ Surely—”\n\nI stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,\nthe thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a second,\nstood out a strong, solid probability.\_ Circumstances knit themselves,\nfitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying\nhitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every ring was\nperfect, the connection complete.\_ I knew, by instinct, how the matter\nstood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the\nreader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his\nexplanation.\n\n“My mother’s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who\nmarried Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,\nmerchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.\_ Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre’s\nsolicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle’s death,\nand to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman’s\norphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never\nforgiven, between him and my father.\_ He wrote again a few weeks since,\nto intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of\nher.\_ A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find\nher out.\_ You know the rest.”\_ Again he was going, but I set my back\nagainst the door.\n\n“Do let me speak,” I said; “let me have one moment to draw breath and\nreflect.”\_ I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed\nenough.\_ I resumed—\n\n“Your mother was my father’s sister?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“My aunt, consequently?”\n\nHe bowed.\n\n“My uncle John was your uncle John?\_ You, Diana, and Mary are his\nsister’s children, as I am his brother’s child?”\n\n“Undeniably.”\n\n“You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from\nthe same source?”\n\n“We are cousins; yes.”\n\nI surveyed him.\_ It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud\nof,—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,\nwhen I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with\ngenuine affection and admiration.\_ The two girls, on whom, kneeling down\non the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor\nHouse kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and\ndespair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who\nhad found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.\_\nGlorious discovery to a lonely wretch!\_ This was wealth indeed!—wealth\nto the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections.\_ This was a blessing,\nbright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold:\nrich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.\_ I now\nclapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.\n\n“Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!” I exclaimed.\n\nSt. John smiled.\_ “Did I not say you neglected essential points to\npursue trifles?” he asked.\_ “You were serious when I told you you had\ngot a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.”\n\n“What can you mean?\_ It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and\ndon’t care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,—or\ntwo, if you don’t choose to be counted,—are born into my world\nfull-grown.\_ I say again, I am glad!”\n\nI walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the\nthoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle\nthem:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere\nlong.\_ I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending\nstars,—every one lit me to a purpose or delight.\_ Those who had saved my\nlife, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.\_\nThey were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could\nreunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be\ntheirs too.\_ Were we not four?\_ Twenty thousand pounds shared equally\nwould be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would\nbe done,—mutual happiness secured.\_ Now the wealth did not weigh on me:\nnow it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope,\nenjoyment.\n\nHow I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot\ntell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,\nand was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.\_ He also advised me\nto be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and\ndistraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.\n\n“Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,” I said, “and tell them to come home\ndirectly.\_ Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a\nthousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.”\n\n“Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,” said St. John; “you must\nreally make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.”\n\n“Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?\_\nWill it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle\ndown like an ordinary mortal?”\n\n“You wander: your head becomes confused.\_ I have been too abrupt in\ncommunicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.”\n\n“Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it\nis you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.”\n\n“Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should\ncomprehend better.”\n\n“Explain!\_ What is there to explain?\_ You cannot fail to see that twenty\nthousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew\nand three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?\_ What I\nwant is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the\nfortune that has accrued to them.”\n\n“To you, you mean.”\n\n“I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any\nother.\_ I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly\nungrateful.\_ Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.\_\nI like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,\nand I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.\_ It would please\nand benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and\noppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine\nin justice, though it might in law.\_ I abandon to you, then, what is\nabsolutely superfluous to me.\_ Let there be no opposition, and no\ndiscussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the\npoint at once.”\n\n“This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a\nmatter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.”\n\n“Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of\nthe case?”\n\n“I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.\_\nBesides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own\nefforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.\_\nAfter all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear\nconscience, consider it absolutely your own.”\n\n“With me,” said I, “it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of\nconscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an\nopportunity of doing so.\_ Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a\nyear, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a\nglimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to\nmyself lifelong friends.”\n\n“You think so now,” rejoined St. John, “because you do not know what it\nis to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a\nnotion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the\nplace it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would\nopen to you: you cannot—”\n\n“And you,” I interrupted, “cannot at all imagine the craving I have for\nfraternal and sisterly love.\_ I never had a home, I never had brothers\nor sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to\nadmit me and own me, are you?”\n\n“Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without\nstipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.”\n\n“Brother?\_ Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!\_ Sisters?\_ Yes;\nslaving amongst strangers!\_ I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned\nand do not merit!\_ You, penniless!\_ Famous equality and fraternisation!\_\nClose union!\_ Intimate attachment!”\n\n“But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness\nmay be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may\nmarry.”\n\n“Nonsense, again!\_ Marry!\_ I don’t want to marry, and never shall\nmarry.”\n\n“That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the\nexcitement under which you labour.”\n\n“It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my\ninclinations to the bare thought of marriage.\_ No one would take me for\nlove; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money\nspeculation.\_ And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien,\ndifferent from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full\nfellow-feeling.\_ Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the\nwords I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them\nsincerely.”\n\n“I think I can.\_ I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know\non what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and\nadmiration of their talents.\_ You too have principle and mind: your\ntastes and habits resemble Diana’s and Mary’s; your presence is always\nagreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found\na salutary solace.\_ I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my\nheart for you, as my third and youngest sister.”\n\n“Thank you: that contents me for to-night.\_ Now you had better go; for\nif you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some\nmistrustful scruple.”\n\n“And the school, Miss Eyre?\_ It must now be shut up, I suppose?”\n\n“No.\_ I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.”\n\nHe smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.\n\nI need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments\nI used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.\_ My\ntask was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my\ncousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on\nmaking a just division of the property—as they must in their own hearts\nhave felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been\ninnately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what\nI wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the\naffair to arbitration.\_ The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able\nlawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.\_ The\ninstruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I,\neach became possessed of a competency.\n"
