title: "\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;\nbut this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of\nwashing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.\_ A change had taken place\nin the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,\nwhistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long,\nhad made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to\nice.\n\nBefore the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I\nfelt ready to perish with cold.\_ Breakfast-time came at last, and this\nmorning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the\nquantity small.\_ How small my portion seemed!\_ I wished it had been\ndoubled.\n\nIn the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class,\nand regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only\nbeen a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an\nactor therein.\_ At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the\nlessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from\ntask to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three\no’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of\nmuslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me\nto sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the\nsame.\_ At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one\nclass still stood round Miss Scatcherd’s chair reading, and as all was\nquiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the\nmanner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or\ncommendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.\_ It was English\nhistory: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah:\nat the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the\nclass, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to\nstops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.\_ Even in that obscure\nposition, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant\nnotice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the\nfollowing:—\n\n“Burns” (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by\ntheir surnames, as boys are elsewhere), “Burns, you are standing on the\nside of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.”\_ “Burns, you poke\nyour chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.”\_ “Burns, I insist on your\nholding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,”\n&c. &c.\n\nA chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the\ngirls examined.\_ The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles\nI., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and\nship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every\nlittle difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory\nseemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was\nready with answers on every point.\_ I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd\nwould praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried\nout—\n\n“You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this\nmorning!”\n\nBurns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\_ “Why,” thought I,\n“does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash\nher face, as the water was frozen?”\n\nMy attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a\nskein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to\ntime, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could\nmark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my\nobservations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements.\_ When I returned to my seat,\nthat lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the\nimport; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small\ninner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute,\ncarrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.\_ This\nominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy;\nthen she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the\nteacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with\nthe bunch of twigs.\_ Not a tear rose to Burns’ eye; and, while I paused\nfrom my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a\nsentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive\nface altered its ordinary expression.\n\n“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct you of\nyour slatternly habits: carry the rod away.”\n\nBurns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the\nbook-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,\nand the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.\n\nThe play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the\nday at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five\no’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long\nrestraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in\nthe morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to\nsupply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the\nruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave\none a welcome sense of liberty.\n\nOn the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her\npupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and\nlaughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I\npassed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it\nsnowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;\nputting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful\ntumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.\n\nProbably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would\nhave been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the\nseparation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure\nchaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a\nstrange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl\nmore wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise\nto clamour.\n\nJumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of\nthe fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,\nabsorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of\na book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.\n\n“Is it still ‘Rasselas’?” I asked, coming behind her.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “and I have just finished it.”\n\nAnd in five minutes more she shut it up.\_ I was glad of this.\_ “Now,”\nthought I, “I can perhaps get her to talk.”\_ I sat down by her on the\nfloor.\n\n“What is your name besides Burns?”\n\n“Helen.”\n\n“Do you come a long way from here?”\n\n“I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.”\n\n“Will you ever go back?”\n\n“I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.”\n\n“You must wish to leave Lowood?”\n\n“No! why should I?\_ I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it\nwould be of no use going away until I have attained that object.”\n\n“But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?”\n\n“Cruel?\_ Not at all!\_ She is severe: she dislikes my faults.”\n\n“And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.\_\nIf she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should\nbreak it under her nose.”\n\n“Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.\nBrocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great\ngrief to your relations.\_ It is far better to endure patiently a smart\nwhich nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose\nevil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides,\nthe Bible bids us return good for evil.”\n\n“But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in\nthe middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am\nfar younger than you, and I could not bear it.”\n\n“Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is\nweak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be\nrequired to bear.”\n\nI heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of\nendurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the\nforbearance she expressed for her chastiser.\_ Still I felt that Helen\nBurns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.\_ I suspected\nshe might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter\ndeeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.\n\n“You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?\_ To me you seem very\ngood.”\n\n“Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss\nScatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in\norder; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my\nlessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot\nbear to be subjected to systematic arrangements.\_ This is all very\nprovoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and\nparticular.”\n\n“And cross and cruel,” I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my\naddition: she kept silence.\n\n“Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?”\n\nAt the utterance of Miss Temple’s name, a soft smile flitted over her\ngrave face.\n\n“Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,\neven the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them\ngently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed\nliberally.\_ One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that\neven her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to\ncure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most\nhighly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.”\n\n“That is curious,” said I, “it is so easy to be careful.”\n\n“For you I have no doubt it is.\_ I observed you in your class this\nmorning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed\nto wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.\_\nNow, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss\nScatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the\nvery sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.\_ Sometimes I think\nI am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the\nbubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our\nhouse;—then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened;\nand having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary\nbrook, I have no answer ready.”\n\n“Yet how well you replied this afternoon.”\n\n“It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had\ninterested me.\_ This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was\nwondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and\nunwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity\nit was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no\nfarther than the prerogatives of the crown.\_ If he had but been able to\nlook to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was\ntending!\_ Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor murdered\nking!\_ Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no\nright to shed.\_ How dared they kill him!”\n\nHelen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very\nwell understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject\nshe discussed.\_ I recalled her to my level.\n\n“And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?”\n\n“No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something\nto say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is\nsingularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is\noften just what I wished to gain.”\n\n“Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?”\n\n“Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides\nme.\_ There is no merit in such goodness.”\n\n“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.\_ It is all I\never desire to be.\_ If people were always kind and obedient to those who\nare cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:\nthey would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would\ngrow worse and worse.\_ When we are struck at without a reason, we should\nstrike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to teach the\nperson who struck us never to do it again.”\n\n“You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are\nbut a little untaught girl.”\n\n“But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to\nplease them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me\nunjustly.\_ It is as natural as that I should love those who show me\naffection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.”\n\n“Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and\ncivilised nations disown it.”\n\n“How?\_ I don’t understand.”\n\n“It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most\ncertainly heals injury.”\n\n“What then?”\n\n“Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;\nmake His word your rule, and His conduct your example.”\n\n“What does He say?”\n\n“Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate\nyou and despitefully use you.”\n\n“Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son\nJohn, which is impossible.”\n\nIn her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith\nto pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.\_\nBitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or\nsoftening.\n\nHelen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a\nremark, but she said nothing.\n\n“Well,” I asked impatiently, “is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad\nwoman?”\n\n“She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes\nyour cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely\nyou remember all she has done and said to you!\_ What a singularly deep\nimpression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!\_ No ill-usage\nso brands its record on my feelings.\_ Would you not be happier if you\ntried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it\nexcited?\_ Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity\nor registering wrongs.\_ We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with\nfaults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we\nshall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when\ndebasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh,\nand only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle\nof light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the\ncreature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be\ncommunicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through\ngradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the\nseraph!\_ Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to\ndegenerate from man to fiend?\_ No; I cannot believe that: I hold another\ncreed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in\nwhich I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it\nmakes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.\_\nBesides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the\ncriminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I\nabhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart,\ndegradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too\nlow: I live in calm, looking to the end.”\n\nHelen’s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this\nsentence.\_ I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but\nrather to converse with her own thoughts.\_ She was not allowed much time\nfor meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,\nexclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—\n\n“Helen Burns, if you don’t go and put your drawer in order, and fold up\nyour work this minute, I’ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!”\n\nHelen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor\nwithout reply as without delay.\n"
