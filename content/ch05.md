title: "\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a\nfrightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed\nwith thick black bars.\_ I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow\nsound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,\nuncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my\nfaculties.\_ Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;\nlifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more\ntenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.\_ I rested my head\nagainst a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\n\nIn five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite\nwell that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery\nfire.\_ It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the\nbed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near\nmy pillow, leaning over me.\n\nI felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and\nsecurity, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an\nindividual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.\_\nTurning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me\nthan that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the\nface of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,\nsometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for\nherself and the children she employed a physician.\n\n“Well, who am I?” he asked.\n\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took\nit, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.”\_ Then he laid\nme down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I\nwas not disturbed during the night.\_ Having given some further\ndirections, and intimates that he should call again the next day, he\ndeparted; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat\nin the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all\nthe room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed\nit down.\n\n“Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?” asked Bessie, rather softly.\n\nScarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be\nrough.\_ “I will try.”\n\n“Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?”\n\n“No, thank you, Bessie.”\n\n“Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o’clock; but you\nmay call me if you want anything in the night.”\n\nWonderful civility this!\_ It emboldened me to ask a question.\n\n“Bessie, what is the matter with me?\_ Am I ill?”\n\n“You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you’ll be better\nsoon, no doubt.”\n\nBessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was near.\_ I heard her\nsay—\n\n“Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren’t for my life be\nalone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it’s such a strange\nthing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.\_ Missis\nwas rather too hard.”\n\nSarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering\ntogether for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.\_ I caught scraps of\ntheir conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer\nthe main subject discussed.\n\n“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished”—“A great\nblack dog behind him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber door”—“A light in\nthe churchyard just over his grave,” &c. &c.\n\nAt last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.\_ For me, the\nwatches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by\ndread: such dread as children only can feel.\n\nNo severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the\nred-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the\nreverberation to this day.\_ Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful\npangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not\nwhat you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only\nuprooting my bad propensities.\n\nNext day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by\nthe nursery hearth.\_ I felt physically weak and broken down: but my\nworse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness\nwhich kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt\ndrop from my cheek than another followed.\_ Yet, I thought, I ought to\nhave been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone\nout in the carriage with their mama.\_ Abbot, too, was sewing in another\nroom, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and\narranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted\nkindness.\_ This state of things should have been to me a paradise of\npeace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and\nthankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a\nstate that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.\n\nBessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a\ntart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,\nnestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir\nin me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had\noften petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it\nmore closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a\nprivilege.\_ This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was\ncordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.\_ Vain\nfavour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished\nfor, too late!\_ I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,\nthe tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and\ntart away.\_ Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted\nas a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels\nfrom the library.\_ This book I had again and again perused with\ndelight.\_ I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a\nvein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the\nelves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under\nmushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at\nlength made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of\nEngland to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,\nand the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being,\nin my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I\nmight one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little\nfields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep,\nand birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty\nmastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.\_\nYet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned\nover its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had,\ntill now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were\ngaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most\ndesolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.\_ I closed the\nbook, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside\nthe untasted tart.\n\nBessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed\nher hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds\nof silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana’s doll.\_\nMeantime she sang: her song was—\n\n“In the days when we went gipsying,\n \_\_ A long time ago.”\n\n\nI had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for\nBessie had a sweet voice,—at least, I thought so.\_ But now, though her\nvoice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.\_\nSometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low,\nvery lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence of\na funeral hymn.\_ She passed into another ballad, this time a really\ndoleful one.\n\n“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;\n \_\_ Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;\n Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary\n \_\_ Over the path of the poor orphan child.\n\nWhy did they send me so far and so lonely,\n \_\_ Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?\n Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only\n \_\_ Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.\n\nYet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,\n \_\_ Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,\n God, in His mercy, protection is showing,\n \_\_ Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.\n\nEv’n should I fall o’er the broken bridge passing,\n \_\_ Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,\n Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,\n \_\_ Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.\n\nThere is a thought that for strength should avail me,\n \_\_ Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;\n Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;\n \_\_ God is a friend to the poor orphan child.”\n\n\n“Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,” said Bessie as she finished.\_ She might as\nwell have said to the fire, “don’t burn!” but how could she divine the\nmorbid suffering to which I was a prey?\_ In the course of the morning\nMr. Lloyd came again.\n\n“What, already up!” said he, as he entered the nursery.\_ “Well, nurse,\nhow is she?”\n\nBessie answered that I was doing very well.\n\n“Then she ought to look more cheerful.\_ Come here, Miss Jane: your name\nis Jane, is it not?”\n\n“Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.”\n\n“Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what\nabout?\_ Have you any pain?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Oh!\_ I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis\nin the carriage,” interposed Bessie.\n\n“Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.”\n\nI thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge,\nI answered promptly, “I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate\ngoing out in the carriage.\_ I cry because I am miserable.”\n\n“Oh fie, Miss!” said Bessie.\n\nThe good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.\_ I was standing before\nhim; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and\ngrey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he\nhad a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.\_ Having considered me\nat leisure, he said—\n\n“What made you ill yesterday?”\n\n“She had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in her word.\n\n“Fall! why, that is like a baby again!\_ Can’t she manage to walk at her\nage?\_ She must be eight or nine years old.”\n\n“I was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by\nanother pang of mortified pride; “but that did not make me ill,” I\nadded; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\n\nAs he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang\nfor the servants’ dinner; he knew what it was.\_ “That’s for you, nurse,”\nsaid he; “you can go down; I’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come\nback.”\n\nBessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because\npunctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.\n\n“The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?” pursued Mr. Lloyd when\nBessie was gone.\n\n“I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.”\n\nI saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.\n\n“Ghost!\_ What, you are a baby after all!\_ You are afraid of ghosts?”\n\n“Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out\nthere.\_ Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if\nthey can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a\ncandle,—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.”\n\n“Nonsense!\_ And is it that makes you so miserable?\_ Are you afraid now\nin daylight?”\n\n“No: but night will come again before long: and besides,—I am\nunhappy,—very unhappy, for other things.”\n\n“What other things?\_ Can you tell me some of them?”\n\nHow much I wished to reply fully to this question!\_ How difficult it was\nto frame any answer!\_ Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their\nfeelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they\nknow not how to express the result of the process in words.\_ Fearful,\nhowever, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief\nby imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a\nmeagre, though, as far as it went, true response.\n\n“For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.”\n\n“You have a kind aunt and cousins.”\n\nAgain I paused; then bunglingly enounced—\n\n“But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room.”\n\nMr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.\n\n“Don’t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?” asked he.\_ “Are\nyou not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?”\n\n“It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here\nthan a servant.”\n\n“Pooh! you can’t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid\nplace?”\n\n“If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can\nnever get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.”\n\n“Perhaps you may—who knows?\_ Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?”\n\n“I think not, sir.”\n\n“None belonging to your father?”\n\n“I don’t know.\_ I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might\nhave some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about\nthem.”\n\n“If you had such, would you like to go to them?”\n\nI reflected.\_ Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to\nchildren: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable\npoverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,\nscanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty\nfor me was synonymous with degradation.\n\n“No; I should not like to belong to poor people,” was my reply.\n\n“Not even if they were kind to you?”\n\nI shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being\nkind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to\nbe uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes\nnursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of\nthe village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase\nliberty at the price of caste.\n\n“But are your relatives so very poor?\_ Are they working people?”\n\n“I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly\nset: I should not like to go a begging.”\n\n“Would you like to go to school?”\n\nAgain I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes\nspoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore\nbackboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise:\nJohn Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed’s\ntastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s accounts of\nschool-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she\nhad lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her\ndetails of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies\nwere, I thought, equally attractive.\_ She boasted of beautiful paintings\nof landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and\npieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they\ncould translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.\_\nBesides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long journey,\nan entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.\n\n“I should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of my\nmusings.\n\n“Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.\_\n“The child ought to have change of air and scene,” he added, speaking to\nhimself; “nerves not in a good state.”\n\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling\nup the gravel-walk.\n\n“Is that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr. Lloyd.\_ “I should like to\nspeak to her before I go.”\n\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way\nout.\_ In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I\npresume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to\nrecommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt\nreadily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject\nwith Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was\nin bed, and, as they thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad\nenough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always\nlooked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots\nunderhand.”\_ Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of\ninfantine Guy Fawkes.\n\nOn that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot’s\ncommunications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that\nmy mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who\nconsidered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so\nirritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that\nafter my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught\nthe typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing\ntown where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then\nprevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died\nwithin a month of each other.\n\nBessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, “Poor Miss Jane\nis to be pitied, too, Abbot.”\n\n“Yes,” responded Abbot; “if she were a nice, pretty child, one might\ncompassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a\nlittle toad as that.”\n\n“Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie: “at any rate, a beauty\nlike Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.”\n\n“Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!” cried the fervent Abbot.\_ “Little\ndarling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour\nas she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh\nrabbit for supper.”\n\n“So could I—with a roast onion.\_ Come, we’ll go down.”\_ They went.\n"
