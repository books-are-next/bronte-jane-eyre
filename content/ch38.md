title: "\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nThe daylight came.\_ I rose at dawn.\_ I busied myself for an hour or two\nwith arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the\norder wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.\_\nMeantime, I heard St. John quit his room.\_ He stopped at my door: I\nfeared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the\ndoor.\_ I took it up.\_ It bore these words—\n\n“You left me too suddenly last night.\_ Had you stayed but a little\nlonger, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the\nangel’s crown.\_ I shall expect your clear decision when I return this\nday fortnight.\_ Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into\ntemptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is\nweak.\_ I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, St. John.”\n\n“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and\nmy flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,\nwhen once that will is distinctly known to me.\_ At any rate, it shall be\nstrong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of\ndoubt, and find the open day of certainty.”\n\nIt was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain\nbeat fast on my casement.\_ I heard the front-door open, and St. John\npass out.\_ Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.\_\nHe took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there\nhe would meet the coach.\n\n“In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,” thought\nI: “I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.\_ I too have some to see and\nask after in England, before I depart for ever.”\n\nIt wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.\_ I filled the interval in\nwalking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had\ngiven my plans their present bent.\_ I recalled that inward sensation I\nhad experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable\nstrangeness.\_ I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned\nwhence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in me—not in the\nexternal world.\_ I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion?\_ I\ncould not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.\_ The\nwondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the\nfoundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the\nsoul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,\nwhence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a\ncry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit,\nwhich neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the\nsuccess of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the\ncumbrous body.\n\n“Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated my musings, “I will know\nsomething of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.\_ Letters\nhave proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them.”\n\nAt breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,\nand should be absent at least four days.\n\n“Alone, Jane?” they asked.\n\n“Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some\ntime been uneasy.”\n\nThey might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had\nbelieved me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had\noften said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained\nfrom comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough\nto travel.\_ I looked very pale, she observed.\_ I replied, that nothing\nailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.\n\nIt was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no\ninquiries—no surmises.\_ Having once explained to them that I could not\nnow be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the\nsilence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free\naction I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.\n\nI left Moor House at three o’clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at\nthe foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach\nwhich was to take me to distant Thornfield.\_ Amidst the silence of those\nsolitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great\ndistance.\_ It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted\none summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and\nobjectless!\_ It stopped as I beckoned.\_ I entered—not now obliged to\npart with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.\_ Once more\non the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.\n\nIt was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.\_ I had set out from Whitcross\non a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the\ncoach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the\nmidst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral\nhills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern\nNorth-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once\nfamiliar face.\_ Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure\nwe were near my bourne.\n\n“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.\n\n“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”\n\n“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself.\_ I got out of the coach,\ngave a box I had into the ostler’s charge, to be kept till I called for\nit; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening\nday gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, “The\nRochester Arms.”\_ My heart leapt up: I was already on my master’s very\nlands.\_ It fell again: the thought struck it:—\n\n“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you\nknow: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,\nwho besides him is there?\_ His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do\nwith him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.\_ You have lost\nyour labour—you had better go no farther,” urged the monitor.\_ “Ask\ninformation of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:\nthey can solve your doubts at once.\_ Go up to that man, and inquire if\nMr. Rochester be at home.”\n\nThe suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on\nit.\_ I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.\_ To prolong\ndoubt was to prolong hope.\_ I might yet once more see the Hall under the\nray of her star.\_ There was the stile before me—the very fields through\nwhich I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury\ntracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I\nwell knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of\nthem.\_ How fast I walked!\_ How I ran sometimes!\_ How I looked forward to\ncatch the first view of the well-known woods!\_ With what feelings I\nwelcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill\nbetween them!\n\nAt last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke\nthe morning stillness.\_ Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.\_\nAnother field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard\nwalls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.\_ “My\nfirst view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold\nbattlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single\nout my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises\nearly: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in\nfront.\_ Could I but see him!—but a moment!\_ Surely, in that case, I\nshould not be so mad as to run to him?\_ I cannot tell—I am not certain.\_\nAnd if I did—what then?\_ God bless him!\_ What then?\_ Who would be hurt\nby my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?\_ I rave:\nperhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or\non the tideless sea of the south.”\n\nI had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:\nthere was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone\npillars crowned by stone balls.\_ From behind one pillar I could peep\nround quietly at the full front of the mansion.\_ I advanced my head with\nprecaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet\ndrawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered\nstation were at my command.\n\nThe crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.\_\nI wonder what they thought.\_ They must have considered I was very\ncareful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and\nreckless.\_ A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my\nniche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in\nfront of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.\_\n“What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have\ndemanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”\n\nHear an illustration, reader.\n\nA lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a\nglimpse of her fair face without waking her.\_ He steals softly over the\ngrass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he\nwithdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.\_ All is still: he again\nadvances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he\nlifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of\nbeauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest.\_ How hurried was their\nfirst glance!\_ But how they fix!\_ How he starts!\_ How he suddenly and\nvehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,\ntouch with his finger!\_ How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,\nand gazes on it wildly!\_ He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he\nno longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he\ncan make.\_ He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone\ndead.\n\nI looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened\nruin.\n\nNo need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber\nlattices, fearing life was astir behind them!\_ No need to listen for\ndoors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!\_ The\nlawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.\_ The\nfront was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very\nhigh and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no\nroof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.\n\nAnd there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome\nwild.\_ No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never\nreceived an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church\naisle.\_ The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had\nfallen—by conflagration: but how kindled?\_ What story belonged to this\ndisaster?\_ What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had\nfollowed upon it?\_ Had life been wrecked as well as property?\_ If so,\nwhose?\_ Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even\ndumb sign, mute token.\n\nIn wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated\ninterior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late\noccurrence.\_ Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void\narch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the\ndrenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and\nweed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.\_ And oh!\nwhere meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?\_ In what land?\_\nUnder what auspices?\_ My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church\ntower near the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Rochester,\nsharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?”\n\nSome answer must be had to these questions.\_ I could find it nowhere but\nat the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.\_ The host himself brought\nmy breakfast into the parlour.\_ I requested him to shut the door and sit\ndown: I had some questions to ask him.\_ But when he complied, I scarcely\nknew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.\_ And yet\nthe spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for\na tale of misery.\_ The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.\n\n“You know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last.\n\n“Yes, ma’am; I lived there once.”\n\n“Did you?”\_ Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.\n\n“I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added.\n\nThe late!\_ I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been\ntrying to evade.\n\n“The late!” I gasped.\_ “Is he dead?”\n\n“I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained.\_ I\nbreathed again: my blood resumed its flow.\_ Fully assured by these words\nthat Mr. Edward—my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he\nwas!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman.”\_\nGladdening words!\_ It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever\nthe disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity.\_ Since he was\nnot in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the\nAntipodes.\n\n“Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?” I asked, knowing, of\ncourse, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the\ndirect question as to where he really was.\n\n“No, ma’am—oh, no!\_ No one is living there.\_ I suppose you are a\nstranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last\nautumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about\nharvest-time.\_ A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable\nproperty destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.\_ The\nfire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from\nMillcote, the building was one mass of flame.\_ It was a terrible\nspectacle: I witnessed it myself.”\n\n“At dead of night!” I muttered.\_ Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality\nat Thornfield.\_ “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded.\n\n“They guessed, ma’am: they guessed.\_ Indeed, I should say it was\nascertained beyond a doubt.\_ You are not perhaps aware,” he continued,\nedging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that\nthere was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”\n\n“I have heard something of it.”\n\n“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am: people even for some\nyears was not absolutely certain of her existence.\_ No one saw her: they\nonly knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what\nshe was it was difficult to conjecture.\_ They said Mr. Edward had\nbrought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.\_\nBut a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”\n\nI feared now to hear my own story.\_ I endeavoured to recall him to the\nmain fact.\n\n“And this lady?”\n\n“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s\nwife!\_ The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.\_ There was\na young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”\n\n“But the fire,” I suggested.\n\n“I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with.\_ The\nservants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was\nafter her continually.\_ They used to watch him—servants will, you know,\nma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him\nthought her so very handsome.\_ She was a little small thing, they say,\nalmost like a child.\_ I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the\nhouse-maid, tell of her.\_ Leah liked her well enough.\_ Mr. Rochester was\nabout forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen\nof his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were\nbewitched.\_ Well, he would marry her.”\n\n“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but\nnow I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.\_\nWas it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?”\n\n“You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody\nbut her, that set it going.\_ She had a woman to take care of her called\nMrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one\nfault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—she kept a\nprivate bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over-much.\_\nIt is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was\ndangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,\nthe mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of\nher pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the\nhouse, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.\_ They say she\nhad nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about\nthat.\_ However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the\nroom next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her\nway to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as if she\nknew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)—and she\nkindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it,\nfortunately.\_ The governess had run away two months before; and for all\nMr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he\nhad in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew\nsavage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but\nhe got dangerous after he lost her.\_ He would be alone, too.\_ He sent\nMrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he\ndid it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she\ndeserved it—she was a very good woman.\_ Miss Adèle, a ward he had, was\nput to school.\_ He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut\nhimself up like a hermit at the Hall.”\n\n“What! did he not leave England?”\n\n“Leave England?\_ Bless you, no!\_ He would not cross the door-stones of\nthe house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the\ngrounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my\nopinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he\nwas before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am.\_\nHe was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he\nwas not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if\never man had.\_ I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have\noften wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to\nThornfield Hall.”\n\n“Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”\n\n“Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning\nabove and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them\ndown himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.\_ And\nthen they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was\nstanding, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till\nthey could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own\neyes.\_ She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it\nstreaming against the flames as she stood.\_ I witnessed, and several\nmore witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the\nroof; we heard him call ‘Bertha!’\_ We saw him approach her; and then,\nma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed\non the pavement.”\n\n\n\n“Dead?”\n\n“Dead!\_ Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were\nscattered.”\n\n“Good God!”\n\n“You may well say so, ma’am: it was frightful!”\n\nHe shuddered.\n\n“And afterwards?” I urged.\n\n“Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are\nonly some bits of walls standing now.”\n\n“Were any other lives lost?”\n\n“No—perhaps it would have been better if there had.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Poor Mr. Edward!” he ejaculated, “I little thought ever to have seen\nit!\_ Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first\nmarriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one\nliving: but I pity him, for my part.”\n\n“You said he was alive?” I exclaimed.\n\n“Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.”\n\n“Why?\_ How?”\_ My blood was again running cold.\_ “Where is he?” I\ndemanded.\_ “Is he in England?”\n\n“Ay—ay—he’s in England; he can’t get out of England, I fancy—he’s a\nfixture now.”\n\nWhat agony was this!\_ And the man seemed resolved to protract it.\n\n“He is stone-blind,” he said at last.\_ “Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.\nEdward.”\n\nI had dreaded worse.\_ I had dreaded he was mad.\_ I summoned strength to\nask what had caused this calamity.\n\n“It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,\nma’am: he wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out before\nhim.\_ As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester\nhad flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash—all\nfell.\_ He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a\nbeam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was\nknocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had\nto amputate it directly.\_ The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of\nthat also.\_ He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a cripple.”\n\n“Where is he?\_ Where does he now live?”\n\n“At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:\nquite a desolate spot.”\n\n“Who is with him?”\n\n“Old John and his wife: he would have none else.\_ He is quite broken\ndown, they say.”\n\n“Have you any sort of conveyance?”\n\n“We have a chaise, ma’am, a very handsome chaise.”\n\n“Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to\nFerndean before dark this day, I’ll pay both you and him twice the hire\nyou usually demand.”\n"
