title: "\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nMr. Rochester had given me but one week’s leave of absence: yet a month\nelapsed before I quitted Gateshead.\_ I wished to leave immediately after\nthe funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off\nto London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson,\nwho had come down to direct his sister’s interment and settle the family\naffairs.\_ Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from\nher she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor\naid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and\nselfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for\nher and packing her dresses.\_ It is true, that while I worked, she would\nidle; and I thought to myself, “If you and I were destined to live\nalways together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different\nfooting.\_ I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing\nparty; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to\naccomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also,\non your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed\nin your own breast.\_ It is only because our connection happens to be\nvery transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I\nconsent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.”\n\nAt last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request me\nto stay another week.\_ Her plans required all her time and attention,\nshe said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day\nlong she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,\nemptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any\none.\_ She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer\nnotes of condolence.\n\nOne morning she told me I was at liberty.\_ “And,” she added, “I am\nobliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!\_ There\nis some difference between living with such an one as you and with\nGeorgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.\_\nTo-morrow,” she continued, “I set out for the Continent.\_ I shall take\nup my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call it;\nthere I shall be quiet and unmolested.\_ I shall devote myself for a time\nto the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study\nof the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect\nit is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things\ndecently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably\ntake the veil.”\n\nI neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to\ndissuade her from it.\_ “The vocation will fit you to a hair,” I thought:\n“much good may it do you!”\n\nWhen we parted, she said: “Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:\nyou have some sense.”\n\nI then returned: “You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you\nhave, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French\nconvent.\_ However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don’t\nmuch care.”\n\n“You are in the right,” said she; and with these words we each went our\nseparate way.\_ As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or\nher sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an\nadvantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that\nEliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent\nwhere she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with\nher fortune.\n\nHow people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or\nshort, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.\_ I had\nknown what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long\nwalk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was\nto come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a\ngood fire, and to be unable to get either.\_ Neither of these returnings\nwas very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,\nincreasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.\_ The return\nto Thornfield was yet to be tried.\n\nMy journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night\nspent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.\_ During the first twelve\nhours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured\nand discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.\_ I mused on\nthe funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and\nservants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent\nchurch, the solemn service.\_ Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I\nbeheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a\nconvent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities\nof person and character.\_ The evening arrival at the great town\nof—scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid\ndown on my traveller’s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.\n\nI was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?\_ Not\nlong; of that I was sure.\_ I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim\nof my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had\nleft for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a\nfortnight.\_ Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements\nfor his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said\nthe idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but\nfrom what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could\nno longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.\_ “You would be\nstrangely incredulous if you did doubt it,” was my mental comment.\_ “I\ndon’t doubt it.”\n\nThe question followed, “Where was I to go?”\_ I dreamt of Miss Ingram all\nthe night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of\nThornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.\nRochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it\nseemed, at both her and me.\n\nI had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did\nnot wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.\_ I proposed to\nwalk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my\nbox in the ostler’s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six\no’clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road\nwhich lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.\n\nIt was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft:\nthe haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far\nfrom cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue—where\nblue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and\nthin.\_ The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it—it seemed as\nif there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled\nvapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.\n\nI felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once\nto ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not\nto my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place\nwhere fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.\_ “Mrs.\nFairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,” said I; “and little\nAdèle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well\nyou are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of\nyou.”\n\nBut what is so headstrong as youth?\_ What so blind as inexperience?\_\nThese affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of\nagain looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they\nadded—“Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or\nweeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!”\_ And then I\nstrangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not persuade\nmyself to own and rear—and ran on.\n\nThey are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the\nlabourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their\nrakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.\_ I have but a field\nor two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the\ngates.\_ How full the hedges are of roses!\_ But I have no time to gather\nany; I want to be at the house.\_ I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy\nand flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone\nsteps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his\nhand; he is writing.\n\nWell, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a\nmoment I am beyond my own mastery.\_ What does it mean?\_ I did not think\nI should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the\npower of motion in his presence.\_ I will go back as soon as I can stir:\nI need not make an absolute fool of myself.\_ I know another way to the\nhouse.\_ It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.\n\n“Hillo!” he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.\_ “There you\nare!\_ Come on, if you please.”\n\nI suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being\nscarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm;\nand, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel\nrebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had\nresolved to conceal.\_ But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet\nto behave with decent composure.\n\n“And this is Jane Eyre?\_ Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?\_\nYes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come\nclattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into\nthe vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a\ndream or a shade.\_ What the deuce have you done with yourself this last\nmonth?”\n\n“I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.”\n\n“A true Janian reply!\_ Good angels be my guard!\_ She comes from the\nother world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when\nshe meets me alone here in the gloaming!\_ If I dared, I’d touch you, to\nsee if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon offer to\ntake hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh.\_ Truant! truant!”\nhe added, when he had paused an instant.\_ “Absent from me a whole month,\nand forgetting me quite, I’ll be sworn!”\n\nI knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though\nbroken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by\nthe knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.\nRochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of\ncommunicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to\nstray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.\_ His last words\nwere balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him\nwhether I forgot him or not.\_ And he had spoken of Thornfield as my\nhome—would that it were my home!\n\nHe did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.\_ I\ninquired soon if he had not been to London.\n\n“Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.”\n\n“Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.”\n\n“And did she inform you what I went to do?”\n\n“Oh, yes, sir!\_ Everybody knew your errand.”\n\n“You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don’t think it will\nsuit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won’t look like Queen\nBoadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.\_ I wish, Jane, I\nwere a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.\_ Tell me now,\nfairy as you are—can’t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something\nof that sort, to make me a handsome man?”\n\n“It would be past the power of magic, sir;” and, in thought, I added, “A\nloving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or\nrather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.”\n\nMr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to\nme incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my\nabrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had\nof his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.\_ He seemed to think\nit too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he\nshed it over me now.\n\n“Pass, Janet,” said he, making room for me to cross the stile: “go up\nhome, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend’s\nthreshold.”\n\nAll I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to\ncolloquise further.\_ I got over the stile without a word, and meant to\nleave him calmly.\_ An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round.\_ I\nsaid—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.\_ I am strangely glad\nto get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only home.”\n\nI walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he\ntried.\_ Little Adèle was half wild with delight when she saw me.\_ Mrs.\nFairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.\_ Leah smiled, and\neven Sophie bid me “bon soir” with glee.\_ This was very pleasant; there\nis no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and\nfeeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.\n\nI that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my\ncars against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and\ncoming grief.\_ When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her\nknitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adèle, kneeling on\nthe carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection\nseemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent\nprayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus\nsat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to\ntake pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he\nsupposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted\ndaughter back again, and added that he saw Adèle was “prête à croquer sa\npetite maman Anglaise”—I half ventured to hope that he would, even after\nhis marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his\nprotection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.\n\nA fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.\_\nNothing was said of the master’s marriage, and I saw no preparation\ngoing on for such an event.\_ Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if\nshe had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the\nnegative.\_ Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.\nRochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had\nanswered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could\nnot tell what to make of him.\n\nOne thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no\njourneyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure\nit was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was\nthat distance to an ardent lover?\_ To so practised and indefatigable a\nhorseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning’s ride.\_ I began to\ncherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off;\nthat rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed\ntheir minds.\_ I used to look at my master’s face to see if it were sad\nor fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so\nuniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings.\_ If, in the moments I and my\npupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable\ndejection, he became even gay.\_ Never had he called me more frequently\nto his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never had\nI loved him so well.\n"
