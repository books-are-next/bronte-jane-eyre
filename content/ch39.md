title: "\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nThe manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,\nmoderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.\_\nI had heard of it before.\_ Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and\nsometimes went there.\_ His father had purchased the estate for the sake\nof the game covers.\_ He would have let the house, but could find no\ntenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.\_\nFerndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception\nof some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire\nwhen he went there in the season to shoot.\n\nTo this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the\ncharacteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating\nrain.\_ The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise\nand driver with the double remuneration I had promised.\_ Even when\nwithin a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing\nof it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.\_\nIron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing\nthrough them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked\ntrees.\_ There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle\nbetween hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.\_ I followed\nit, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it\nwould far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.\n\nI thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.\_ The darkness\nof natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.\_ I looked round\nin search of another road.\_ There was none: all was interwoven stem,\ncolumnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.\n\nI proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little;\npresently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light,\ndistinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying\nwalls.\_ Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a\nspace of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a\nsemicircle.\_ There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad\ngravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of\nthe forest.\_ The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the\nwindows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one\nstep led up to it.\_ The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms\nhad said, “quite a desolate spot.”\_ It was as still as a church on a\nweek-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound\naudible in its vicinage.\n\n“Can there be life here?” I asked.\n\nYes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow\nfront-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the\ngrange.\n\nIt opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the\nstep; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel\nwhether it rained.\_ Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my\nmaster, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.\n\nI stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine\nhim, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.\_ It was a sudden\nmeeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.\_ I had\nno difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from\nhasty advance.\n\nHis form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port\nwas still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features\naltered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could his\nathletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.\_ But in his\ncountenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that\nreminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous\nto approach in his sullen woe.\_ The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes\ncruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.\n\nAnd, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?—if you do,\nyou little know me.\_ A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should\ndare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly\nsealed beneath it: but not yet.\_ I would not accost him yet.\n\nHe descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the\ngrass-plat.\_ Where was his daring stride now?\_ Then he paused, as if he\nknew not which way to turn.\_ He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;\ngazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the\namphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.\_ He\nstretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept\nhidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what\nlay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards\noff where he stood.\_ He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and\nstood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered\nhead.\_ At this moment John approached him from some quarter.\n\n“Will you take my arm, sir?” he said; “there is a heavy shower coming\non: had you not better go in?”\n\n“Let me alone,” was the answer.\n\nJohn withdrew without having observed me.\_ Mr. Rochester now tried to\nwalk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain.\_ He groped his way back to\nthe house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.\n\nI now drew near and knocked: John’s wife opened for me.\_ “Mary,” I said,\n“how are you?”\n\nShe started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.\_ To her hurried\n“Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?”\_\nI answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,\nwhere John now sat by a good fire.\_ I explained to them, in few words,\nthat I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and\nthat I was come to see Mr. Rochester.\_ I asked John to go down to the\nturn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk,\nwhich I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I\nquestioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House\nfor the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though\ndifficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.\_ Just\nat this moment the parlour-bell rang.\n\n“When you go in,” said I, “tell your master that a person wishes to\nspeak to him, but do not give my name.”\n\n“I don’t think he will see you,” she answered; “he refuses everybody.”\n\nWhen she returned, I inquired what he had said.\_ “You are to send in\nyour name and your business,” she replied.\_ She then proceeded to fill a\nglass with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.\n\n“Is that what he rang for?” I asked.\n\n“Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.”\n\n“Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.”\n\nI took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.\_ The tray\nshook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my\nribs loud and fast.\_ Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.\n\nThis parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the\ngrate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,\nold-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.\_ His\nold dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up\nas if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.\_ Pilot pricked up his\nears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and\nbounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.\_ I set it\non the table; then patted him, and said softly, “Lie down!”\_ Mr.\nRochester turned mechanically to see what the commotion was: but as he\nsaw nothing, he returned and sighed.\n\n“Give me the water, Mary,” he said.\n\nI approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,\nstill excited.\n\n“What is the matter?” he inquired.\n\n“Down, Pilot!” I again said.\_ He checked the water on its way to his\nlips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.\_ “This is\nyou, Mary, is it not?”\n\n“Mary is in the kitchen,” I answered.\n\nHe put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,\nhe did not touch me.\_ “Who is this?\_ Who is this?” he demanded, trying,\nas it seemed, to see with those sightless eyes—unavailing and\ndistressing attempt!\_ “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered, imperiously\nand aloud.\n\n“Will you have a little more water, sir?\_ I spilt half of what was in\nthe glass,” I said.\n\n“Who is it?\_ What is it?\_ Who speaks?”\n\n“Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.\_ I came only this\nevening,” I answered.\n\n“Great God!—what delusion has come over me?\_ What sweet madness has\nseized me?”\n\n“No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,\nyour health too sound for frenzy.”\n\n“And where is the speaker?\_ Is it only a voice?\_ Oh!\_ I cannot see,\nbut I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.\_\nWhatever—whoever you are—be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!”\n\nHe groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.\n\n“Her very fingers!” he cried; “her small, slight fingers!\_ If so there\nmust be more of her.”\n\nThe muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my\nshoulder—neck—waist—I was entwined and gathered to him.\n\n“Is it Jane?\_ What is it?\_ This is her shape—this is her size—”\n\n“And this her voice,” I added.\_ “She is all here: her heart, too.\_ God\nbless you, sir!\_ I am glad to be so near you again.”\n\n“Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said.\n\n“My dear master,” I answered, “I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I am\ncome back to you.”\n\n“In truth?—in the flesh?\_ My living Jane?”\n\n“You touch me, sir,—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a\ncorpse, nor vacant like air, am I?”\n\n“My living darling!\_ These are certainly her limbs, and these her\nfeatures; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.\_ It is a dream;\nsuch dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to\nmy heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus—and felt that she loved\nme, and trusted that she would not leave me.”\n\n“Which I never will, sir, from this day.”\n\n“Never will, says the vision?\_ But I always woke and found it an empty\nmockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—my life dark, lonely,\nhopeless—my soul athirst and forbidden to drink—my heart famished and\nnever to be fed.\_ Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will\nfly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before\nyou go—embrace me, Jane.”\n\n“There, sir—and there!”’\n\nI pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept his\nhair from his brow, and kissed that too.\_ He suddenly seemed to arouse\nhimself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.\n\n“It is you—is it, Jane?\_ You are come back to me then?”\n\n“I am.”\n\n“And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?\_ And you are\nnot a pining outcast amongst strangers?”\n\n“No, sir!\_ I am an independent woman now.”\n\n“Independent!\_ What do you mean, Jane?”\n\n“My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.”\n\n“Ah! this is practical—this is real!” he cried: “I should never dream\nthat.\_ Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and\npiquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into\nit.—What, Janet!\_ Are you an independent woman?\_ A rich woman?”\n\n“If you won’t let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close\nup to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want\ncompany of an evening.”\n\n“But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will\nlook after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter\nlike me?”\n\n“I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own\nmistress.”\n\n“And you will stay with me?”\n\n“Certainly—unless you object.\_ I will be your neighbour, your nurse,\nyour housekeeper.\_ I find you lonely: I will be your companion—to read\nto you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes\nand hands to you.\_ Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you\nshall not be left desolate, so long as I live.”\n\nHe replied not: he seemed serious—abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened\nhis lips as if to speak: he closed them again.\_ I felt a little\nembarrassed.\_ Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities;\nand he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.\_ I had\nindeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to\nbe his wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed,\nhad buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.\_ But no\nhint to that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more\novercast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and\nwas perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw\nmyself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me closer.\n\n“No—no—Jane; you must not go.\_ No—I have touched you, heard you, felt\nthe comfort of your presence—the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot\ngive up these joys.\_ I have little left in myself—I must have you.\_ The\nworld may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not signify.\_ My\nvery soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly\nvengeance on its frame.”\n\n“Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.”\n\n“Yes—but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand\nanother.\_ You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and\nchair—to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate\nheart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for\nthose you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.\_ I suppose I\nshould now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think\nso?\_ Come—tell me.”\n\n“I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if\nyou think it better.”\n\n“But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young—you must marry\none day.”\n\n“I don’t care about being married.”\n\n“You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make\nyou care—but—a sightless block!”\n\nHe relapsed again into gloom.\_ I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,\nand took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where\nthe difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite\nrelieved from my previous embarrassment.\_ I resumed a livelier vein of\nconversation.\n\n“It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,” said I, parting his\nthick and long uncut locks; “for I see you are being metamorphosed into\na lion, or something of that sort.\_ You have a ‘faux air’ of\nNebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair\nreminds me of eagles’ feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds’\nclaws or not, I have not yet noticed.”\n\n“On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,” he said, drawing the\nmutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.\_ “It is a mere\nstump—a ghastly sight!\_ Don’t you think so, Jane?”\n\n“It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes—and the scar of\nfire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of\nloving you too well for all this; and making too much of you.”\n\n“I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my\ncicatrised visage.”\n\n“Did you?\_ Don’t tell me so—lest I should say something disparaging to\nyour judgment.\_ Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,\nand have the hearth swept up.\_ Can you tell when there is a good fire?”\n\n“Yes; with the right eye I see a glow—a ruddy haze.”\n\n“And you see the candles?”\n\n“Very dimly—each is a luminous cloud.”\n\n“Can you see me?”\n\n“No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.”\n\n“When do you take supper?”\n\n“I never take supper.”\n\n“But you shall have some to-night.\_ I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,\nonly you forget.”\n\nSummoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared\nhim, likewise, a comfortable repast.\_ My spirits were excited, and with\npleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time\nafter.\_ There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and\nvivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I\nsuited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.\_\nDelightful consciousness!\_ It brought to life and light my whole nature:\nin his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.\_ Blind as he\nwas, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his\nlineaments softened and warmed.\n\nAfter supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,\nwhat I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very\npartial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.\_\nBesides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord—to open no fresh well\nof emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.\_ Cheered,\nas I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.\_ If a moment’s silence\nbroke the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say,\n“Jane.”\n\n“You are altogether a human being, Jane?\_ You are certain of that?”\n\n\n\n“I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.”\n\n“Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise\non my lone hearth?\_ I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a\nhireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting\nJohn’s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.”\n\n“Because I had come in, in Mary’s stead, with the tray.”\n\n“And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.\_\nWho can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for\nmonths past?\_ Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;\nfeeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger\nwhen I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very\ndelirium of desire to behold my Jane again.\_ Yes: for her restoration I\nlonged, far more than for that of my lost sight.\_ How can it be that\nJane is with me, and says she loves me?\_ Will she not depart as suddenly\nas she came?\_ To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.”\n\nA commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed\nideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this\nframe of mind.\_ I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that\nthey were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make\nthem grow as broad and black as ever.\n\n“Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,\nat some fatal moment, you will again desert me—passing like a shadow,\nwhither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards\nundiscoverable?\n\n“Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?”\n\n“What for, Jane?”\n\n“Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.\_ I find you rather alarming,\nwhen I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am\nsure, you are more like a brownie.”\n\n“Am I hideous, Jane?”\n\n“Very, sir: you always were, you know.”\n\n“Humph!\_ The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have\nsojourned.”\n\n“Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times\nbetter people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in\nyour life: quite more refined and exalted.”\n\n“Who the deuce have you been with?”\n\n“If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your\nhead; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my\nsubstantiality.”\n\n“Who have you been with, Jane?”\n\n“You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till\nto-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of\nsecurity that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.\_ By\nthe bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of\nwater then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried\nham.”\n\n“You mocking changeling—fairy-born and human-bred!\_ You make me feel as\nI have not felt these twelve months.\_ If Saul could have had you for his\nDavid, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the\nharp.”\n\n“There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.\_ Now I’ll leave you: I\nhave been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.\_\nGood night.”\n\n“Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have\nbeen?”\n\nI laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.\_ “A good\nidea!”\_ I thought with glee.\_ “I see I have the means of fretting him\nout of his melancholy for some time to come.”\n\nVery early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one\nroom to another.\_ As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: “Is\nMiss Eyre here?”\_ Then: “Which room did you put her into?\_ Was it dry?\_\nIs she up?\_ Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come\ndown.”\n\nI came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.\_\nEntering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered\nmy presence.\_ It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of\nthat vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.\_ He sat in his\nchair—still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now\nhabitual sadness marking his strong features.\_ His countenance reminded\none of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit—and alas! it was not\nhimself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was\ndependent on another for that office!\_ I had meant to be gay and\ncareless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to\nthe quick: still I accosted him with what vivacity I could.\n\n“It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,” I said.\_ “The rain is over and\ngone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk\nsoon.”\n\nI had wakened the glow: his features beamed.\n\n“Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!\_ Come to me.\_ You are not gone:\nnot vanished?\_ I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over\nthe wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun\nhad rays.\_ All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane’s tongue\nto my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine\nI can feel is in her presence.”\n\nThe water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just\nas if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a\nsparrow to become its purveyor.\_ But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed\noff the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.\n\nMost of the morning was spent in the open air.\_ I led him out of the wet\nand wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how\nbrilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked\nrefreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky.\_ I sought a seat for him in\na hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let\nhim, when seated, place me on his knee.\_ Why should I, when both he and\nI were happier near than apart?\_ Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.\_ He\nbroke out suddenly while clasping me in his arms—\n\n“Cruel, cruel deserter!\_ Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you\nhad fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after\nexamining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor\nanything which could serve as an equivalent!\_ A pearl necklace I had\ngiven you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left\ncorded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.\_ What\ncould my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?\_ And what\ndid she do?\_ Let me hear now.”\n\nThus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.\_ I\nsoftened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and\nstarvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict\nunnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart\ndeeper than I wished.\n\nI should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my\nway: I should have told him my intention.\_ I should have confided in\nhim: he would never have forced me to be his mistress.\_ Violent as he\nhad seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too\ntenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half\nhis fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than\nI should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.\_ I had endured,\nhe was certain, more than I had confessed to him.\n\n“Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,” I\nanswered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at\nMoor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.\_ The\naccession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due\norder.\_ Of course, St. John Rivers’ name came in frequently in the\nprogress of my tale.\_ When I had done, that name was immediately taken\nup.\n\n“This St. John, then, is your cousin?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You have spoken of him often: do you like him?”\n\n“He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.”\n\n“A good man.\_ Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?\_\nOr what does it mean?”\n\n“St John was only twenty-nine, sir.”\n\n“‘Jeune encore,’ as the French say.\_ Is he a person of low stature,\nphlegmatic, and plain.\_ A person whose goodness consists rather in his\nguiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue.”\n\n“He is untiringly active.\_ Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to\nperform.”\n\n“But his brain?\_ That is probably rather soft?\_ He means well: but you\nshrug your shoulders to hear him talk?”\n\n“He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.\_ His brain\nis first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.”\n\n“Is he an able man, then?”\n\n“Truly able.”\n\n“A thoroughly educated man?”\n\n“St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.”\n\n“His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?—priggish and\nparsonic?”\n\n“I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they\nmust suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.”\n\n“His appearance,—I forget what description you gave of his appearance;—a\nsort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted\nup on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?”\n\n“St. John dresses well.\_ He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue\neyes, and a Grecian profile.”\n\n(Aside.)\_ “Damn him!”—(To me.)\_ “Did you like him, Jane?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.”\n\nI perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.\_ Jealousy had got\nhold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him\nrespite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.\_ I would not, therefore,\nimmediately charm the snake.\n\n“Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?” was\nthe next somewhat unexpected observation.\n\n“Why not, Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too\noverwhelming contrast.\_ Your words have delineated very prettily a\ngraceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,—tall, fair,\nblue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile.\_ Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,—a\nreal blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the\nbargain.”\n\n“I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like\nVulcan, sir.”\n\n“Well, you can leave me, ma’am: but before you go” (and he retained me\nby a firmer grasp than ever), “you will be pleased just to answer me a\nquestion or two.”\_ He paused.\n\n“What questions, Mr. Rochester?”\n\nThen followed this cross-examination.\n\n“St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his\ncousin?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You would often see him?\_ He would visit the school sometimes?”\n\n“Daily.”\n\n“He would approve of your plans, Jane?\_ I know they would be clever, for\nyou are a talented creature!”\n\n“He approved of them—yes.”\n\n“He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to\nfind?\_ Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.”\n\n“I don’t know about that.”\n\n“You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come\nthere to see you?”\n\n“Now and then?”\n\n“Of an evening?”\n\n“Once or twice.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship\nwas discovered?”\n\n“Five months.”\n\n“Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?”\n\n“Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the\nwindow, and we by the table.”\n\n“Did he study much?”\n\n“A good deal.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Hindostanee.”\n\n“And what did you do meantime?”\n\n“I learnt German, at first.”\n\n“Did he teach you?”\n\n“He did not understand German.”\n\n“Did he teach you nothing?”\n\n“A little Hindostanee.”\n\n“Rivers taught you Hindostanee?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And his sisters also?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Only you?”\n\n“Only me.”\n\n“Did you ask to learn?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“He wished to teach you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nA second pause.\n\n“Why did he wish it?\_ Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?”\n\n“He intended me to go with him to India.”\n\n“Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.\_ He wanted you to marry him?”\n\n“He asked me to marry him.”\n\n“That is a fiction—an impudent invention to vex me.”\n\n“I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,\nand was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.”\n\n“Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.\_ How often am I to say the\nsame thing?\_ Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I\nhave given you notice to quit?”\n\n“Because I am comfortable there.”\n\n“No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with\nme: it is with this cousin—this St. John.\_ Oh, till this moment, I\nthought my little Jane was all mine!\_ I had a belief she loved me even\nwhen she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.\_ Long as we\nhave been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never\nthought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!\_ But it\nis useless grieving.\_ Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.”\n\n“Shake me off, then, sir,—push me away, for I’ll not leave you of my own\naccord.”\n\n“Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds\nso truthful.\_ When I hear it, it carries me back a year.\_ I forget that\nyou have formed a new tie.\_ But I am not a fool—go—”\n\n“Where must I go, sir?”\n\n“Your own way—with the husband you have chosen.”\n\n“Who is that?”\n\n“You know—this St. John Rivers.”\n\n“He is not my husband, nor ever will be.\_ He does not love me: I do not\nlove him.\_ He loves (as he can love, and that is not as you love) a\nbeautiful young lady called Rosamond.\_ He wanted to marry me only\nbecause he thought I should make a suitable missionary’s wife, which she\nwould not have done.\_ He is good and great, but severe; and, for me,\ncold as an iceberg.\_ He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his\nside, nor near him, nor with him.\_ He has no indulgence for me—no\nfondness.\_ He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth—only a few\nuseful mental points.—Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?”\n\nI shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind\nbut beloved master.\_ He smiled.\n\n“What, Jane!\_ Is this true?\_ Is such really the state of matters between\nyou and Rivers?”\n\n“Absolutely, sir!\_ Oh, you need not be jealous!\_ I wanted to tease you a\nlittle to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than\ngrief.\_ But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I\ndo love you, you would be proud and content.\_ All my heart is yours,\nsir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile\nthe rest of me from your presence for ever.”\n\nAgain, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.\n\n“My seared vision!\_ My crippled strength!” he murmured regretfully.\n\nI caressed, in order to soothe him.\_ I knew of what he was thinking, and\nwanted to speak for him, but dared not.\_ As he turned aside his face a\nminute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle\ndown the manly cheek.\_ My heart swelled.\n\n“I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in\nThornfield orchard,” he remarked ere long.\_ “And what right would that\nruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?”\n\n“You are no ruin, sir—no lightning-struck tree: you are green and\nvigorous.\_ Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or\nnot, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they\ngrow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your\nstrength offers them so safe a prop.”\n\nAgain he smiled: I gave him comfort.\n\n“You speak of friends, Jane?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, of friends,” I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant\nmore than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.\_ He\nhelped me.\n\n“Ah!\_ Jane.\_ But I want a wife.”\n\n“Do you, sir?”\n\n“Yes: is it news to you?”\n\n“Of course: you said nothing about it before.”\n\n“Is it unwelcome news?”\n\n“That depends on circumstances, sir—on your choice.”\n\n“Which you shall make for me, Jane.\_ I will abide by your decision.”\n\n“Choose then, sir—her who loves you best.”\n\n“I will at least choose—her I love best.\_ Jane, will you marry me?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait\non?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Truly, Jane?”\n\n“Most truly, sir.”\n\n“Oh! my darling!\_ God bless you and reward you!”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life—if ever I thought a\ngood thought—if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer—if ever I\nwished a righteous wish,—I am rewarded now.\_ To be your wife is, for me,\nto be as happy as I can be on earth.”\n\n“Because you delight in sacrifice.”\n\n“Sacrifice!\_ What do I sacrifice?\_ Famine for food, expectation for\ncontent.\_ To be privileged to put my arms round what I value—to press my\nlips to what I love—to repose on what I trust: is that to make a\nsacrifice?\_ If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.”\n\n“And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.”\n\n“Which are none, sir, to me.\_ I love you better now, when I can really\nbe useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when\nyou disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.”\n\n“Hitherto I have hated to be helped—to be led: henceforth, I feel I\nshall hate it no more.\_ I did not like to put my hand into a hireling’s,\nbut it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane’s little fingers.\_ I\npreferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but\nJane’s soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.\_ Jane suits me: do I suit\nher?”\n\n“To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.”\n\n“The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be\nmarried instantly.”\n\nHe looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.\n\n“We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the\nlicence to get—then we marry.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its\nmeridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.\_ Let me look at\nyour watch.”\n\n“Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no\nuse for it.”\n\n“It is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, sir.\_ Don’t you feel\nhungry?”\n\n“The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.\_ Never mind fine\nclothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.”\n\n“The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.\_ The breeze is still: it\nis quite hot.”\n\n“Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment\nfastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?\_ I have worn it since\nthe day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.”\n\n“We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.”\n\nHe pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.\n\n“Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells\nwith gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.\_ He sees\nnot as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more\nwisely.\_ I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower—breathed\nguilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.\_ I, in my\nstiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of\nbending to the decree, I defied it.\_ Divine justice pursued its course;\ndisasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of\nthe shadow of death.\_ His chastisements are mighty; and one smote me\nwhich has humbled me for ever.\_ You know I was proud of my strength: but\nwhat is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child\ndoes its weakness?\_ Of late, Jane—only—only of late—I began to see and\nacknowledge the hand of God in my doom.\_ I began to experience remorse,\nrepentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.\_ I began sometimes\nto pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.\n\n“Some days since: nay, I can number them—four; it was last Monday night,\na singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy—sorrow,\nsullenness.\_ I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere\nfind you, you must be dead.\_ Late that night—perhaps it might be between\neleven and twelve o’clock—ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated\nGod, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this\nlife, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of\nrejoining Jane.\n\n“I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it\nsoothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and\nonly by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.\_ I longed\nfor thee, Janet!\_ Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!\_ I\nasked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long\nenough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss\nand peace once more.\_ That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged—that\nI could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my\nheart’s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words—‘Jane!\_\nJane!\_ Jane!’”\n\n“Did you speak these words aloud?”\n\n“I did, Jane.\_ If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me\nmad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.”\n\n“And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?”\n\n“Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange\npoint.\_ You will think me superstitious,—some superstition I have in my\nblood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true—true at least it is\nthat I heard what I now relate.\n\n“As I exclaimed ‘Jane!\_ Jane!\_ Jane!’ a voice—I cannot tell whence the\nvoice came, but I know whose voice it was—replied, ‘I am coming: wait\nfor me;’ and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the\nwords—‘Where are you?’\n\n“I’ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my\nmind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.\_ Ferndean\nis buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies\nunreverberating.\_ ‘Where are you?’ seemed spoken amongst mountains; for\nI heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.\_ Cooler and fresher at the\nmoment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in\nsome wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.\_ In spirit, I believe we\nmust have met.\_ You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep,\nJane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for\nthose were your accents—as certain as I live—they were yours!”\n\nReader, it was on Monday night—near midnight—that I too had received the\nmysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it.\_\nI listened to Mr. Rochester’s narrative, but made no disclosure in\nreturn.\_ The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be\ncommunicated or discussed.\_ If I told anything, my tale would be such as\nmust necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer:\nand that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not\nthe deeper shade of the supernatural.\_ I kept these things then, and\npondered them in my heart.\n\n“You cannot now wonder,” continued my master, “that when you rose upon\nme so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any\nother than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence\nand annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted\nbefore.\_ Now, I thank God!\_ I know it to be otherwise.\_ Yes, I thank\nGod!”\n\nHe put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his\nbrow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute\ndevotion.\_ Only the last words of the worship were audible.\n\n“I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered\nmercy.\_ I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead\nhenceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!”\n\nThen he stretched his hand out to be led.\_ I took that dear hand, held\nit a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so\nmuch lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.\_ We\nentered the wood, and wended homeward.\n"
