title: "\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nTwo days are passed.\_ It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me\ndown at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the\nsum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the\nworld.\_ The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.\_ At this\nmoment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of\nthe coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it\nmust remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.\n\nWhitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up\nwhere four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a\ndistance and in darkness.\_ Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest\ntown to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten\nmiles; the farthest, above twenty.\_ From the well-known names of these\ntowns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk\nwith moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.\_ There are great moors\nbehind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond\nthat deep valley at my feet.\_ The population here must be thin, and I\nsee no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north,\nand south—white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the\nheather grows deep and wild to their very verge.\_ Yet a chance traveller\nmight pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder\nwhat I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless\nand lost.\_ I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would\nsound incredible and excite suspicion.\_ Not a tie holds me to human\nsociety at this moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my\nfellow-creatures are—none that saw me would have a kind thought or a\ngood wish for me.\_ I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature:\nI will seek her breast and ask repose.\n\nI struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply\nfurrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I\nturned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a\nhidden angle, I sat down under it.\_ High banks of moor were about me;\nthe crag protected my head: the sky was over that.\n\nSome time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread\nthat wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might\ndiscover me.\_ If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it\nwas the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.\_\nFinding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep\nsilence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took\nconfidence.\_ As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched,\ndreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.\n\nWhat was I to do?\_ Where to go?\_ Oh, intolerable questions, when I could\ndo nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my\nweary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold\ncharity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant\nsympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale\ncould be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!\n\nI touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the\nsummer day.\_ I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled\njust above the chasm ridge.\_ The dew fell, but with propitious softness;\nno breeze whispered.\_ Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she\nloved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only\nmistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.\_\nTo-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother\nwould lodge me without money and without price.\_ I had one morsel of\nbread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed\nthrough at noon with a stray penny—my last coin.\_ I saw ripe bilberries\ngleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a\nhandful and ate them with the bread.\_ My hunger, sharp before, was, if\nnot satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal.\_ I said my evening\nprayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.\n\n\n\nBeside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were\nburied in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for\nthe night-air to invade.\_ I folded my shawl double, and spread it over\nme for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.\_ Thus lodged, I was\nnot, at least—at the commencement of the night, cold.\n\nMy rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.\_ It\nplained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.\_ It\ntrembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter\npity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird\nwith both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain\nattempts to seek him.\n\nWorn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.\_ Night was\ncome, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for\nthe companionship of fear.\_ We know that God is everywhere; but\ncertainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest\nscale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His\nworlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude,\nHis omnipotence, His omnipresence.\_ I had risen to my knees to pray for\nMr. Rochester.\_ Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty\nMilky-way.\_ Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept\nspace like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God.\_\nSure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew\nthat neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.\_ I\nturned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the\nSaviour of spirits.\_ Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God’s, and by God\nwould he be guarded.\_ I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere\nlong in sleep forgot sorrow.\n\nBut next day, Want came to me pale and bare.\_ Long after the little\nbirds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime\nof day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long\nmorning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got\nup, and I looked round me.\n\nWhat a still, hot, perfect day!\_ What a golden desert this spreading\nmoor!\_ Everywhere sunshine.\_ I wished I could live in it and on it.\_ I\nsaw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet\nbilberries.\_ I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that\nI might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.\_ But I was\na human being, and had a human being’s wants: I must not linger where\nthere was nothing to supply them.\_ I rose; I looked back at the bed I\nhad left.\_ Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had\nthat night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that\nthis weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had\nnow but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this\nwilderness.\_ Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its\nrequirements, and pains, and responsibilities.\_ The burden must be\ncarried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the\nresponsibility fulfilled.\_ I set out.\n\nWhitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now\nfervent and high.\_ By no other circumstance had I will to decide my\nchoice.\_ I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done\nenough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost\noverpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a\nstone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart\nand limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.\n\nI turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic\nhills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw\na hamlet and a spire.\_ All the valley at my right hand was full of\npasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran\nzig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the\nsombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.\_ Recalled by the rumbling of\nwheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up\nthe hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.\_ Human life\nand human labour were near.\_ I must struggle on: strive to live and bend\nto toil like the rest.\n\nAbout two o’clock p.m. I entered the village.\_ At the bottom of its one\nstreet there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.\_\nI coveted a cake of bread.\_ With that refreshment I could perhaps regain\na degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.\_ The\nwish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I\nwas amongst my fellow-beings.\_ I felt it would be degrading to faint\nwith hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.\_ Had I nothing about me I could\noffer in exchange for one of these rolls?\_ I considered.\_ I had a small\nsilk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.\_ I could hardly\ntell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.\_ I did\nnot know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably\nthey would not; but I must try.\n\nI entered the shop: a woman was there.\_ Seeing a respectably-dressed\nperson, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.\_ How\ncould she serve me?\_ I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter\nthe request I had prepared.\_ I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,\nthe creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.\_ I only\nbegged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.\_ Disappointed in\nthe expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.\_ She\npointed to a seat; I sank into it.\_ I felt sorely urged to weep; but\nconscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained\nit.\_ Soon I asked her “if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman\nin the village?”\n\n“Yes; two or three.\_ Quite as many as there was employment for.”\n\nI reflected.\_ I was driven to the point now.\_ I was brought face to face\nwith Necessity.\_ I stood in the position of one without a resource,\nwithout a friend, without a coin.\_ I must do something.\_ What?\_ I must\napply somewhere.\_ Where?\n\n“Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was\nwanted?”\n\n“Nay; she couldn’t say.”\n\n“What was the chief trade in this place?\_ What did most of the people\ndo?”\n\n“Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver’s\nneedle-factory, and at the foundry.”\n\n“Did Mr. Oliver employ women?”\n\n“Nay; it was men’s work.”\n\n“And what do the women do?”\n\n“I knawn’t,” was the answer.\_ “Some does one thing, and some another.\_\nPoor folk mun get on as they can.”\n\nShe seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to\nimportune her?\_ A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently\nwanted.\_ I took leave.\n\nI passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right\nhand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an\ninducement to enter any.\_ I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to\na little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.\_ Much\nexhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside\ninto a lane and sat down under the hedge.\_ Ere many minutes had elapsed,\nI was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a\nresource, or at least an informant.\_ A pretty little house stood at the\ntop of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and\nbrilliantly blooming.\_ I stopped at it.\_ What business had I to approach\nthe white door or touch the glittering knocker?\_ In what way could it\npossibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve\nme?\_ Yet I drew near and knocked.\_ A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young\nwoman opened the door.\_ In such a voice as might be expected from a\nhopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and faltering—I\nasked if a servant was wanted here?\n\n“No,” said she; “we do not keep a servant.”\n\n“Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?” I\ncontinued.\_ “I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.\_ I\nwant some work: no matter what.”\n\nBut it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:\nbesides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,\nposition, tale.\_ She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give me no\ninformation,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but\nit shut me out.\_ If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I\nshould have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.\n\nI could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no\nprospect of aid was visible.\_ I should have longed rather to deviate to\na wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer\ninviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s\ncravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance\nof food.\_ Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the vulture,\nhunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.\n\nI drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I\nwandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim\nto ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.\_ Meantime, the\nafternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving\ndog.\_ In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened\ntowards it.\_ Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a\nwell-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.\_\nI remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no\nfriends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for\nintroduction and aid.\_ It is the clergyman’s function to help—at least\nwith advice—those who wished to help themselves.\_ I seemed to have\nsomething like a right to seek counsel here.\_ Renewing then my courage,\nand gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.\_ I reached the\nhouse, and knocked at the kitchen-door.\_ An old woman opened: I asked\nwas this the parsonage?\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Was the clergyman in?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Would he be in soon?”\n\n“No, he was gone from home.”\n\n“To a distance?”\n\n“Not so far—happen three mile.\_ He had been called away by the sudden\ndeath of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay\nthere a fortnight longer.”\n\n“Was there any lady of the house?”\n\n“Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;” and of her,\nreader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was\nsinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.\n\nOnce more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes of\nbread in the little shop.\_ Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to\nallay the pang of famine!\_ Instinctively I turned my face again to the\nvillage; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were\nthere besides the woman I ventured the request—“Would she give me a roll\nfor this handkerchief?”\n\nShe looked at me with evident suspicion: “Nay, she never sold stuff i’\nthat way.”\n\nAlmost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.\_ “How\ncould she tell where I had got the handkerchief?” she said.\n\n“Would she take my gloves?”\n\n“No! what could she do with them?”\n\nReader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.\_ Some say there is\nenjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I\ncan scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral\ndegradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a\nrecollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.\_ I blamed none of those who\nrepulsed me.\_ I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not\nbe helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a\nwell-dressed beggar inevitably so.\_ To be sure, what I begged was\nemployment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?\_\nNot, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and\nwho knew nothing about my character.\_ And as to the woman who would not\ntake my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if\nthe offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.\_ Let me\ncondense now.\_ I am sick of the subject.\n\nA little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which\nthe farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.\_ I\nstopped and said—\n\n“Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.”\_ He cast on\nme a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice\nfrom his loaf, and gave it to me.\_ I imagine he did not think I was a\nbeggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his\nbrown loaf.\_ As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and\nate it.\n\nI could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the\nwood I have before alluded to.\_ But my night was wretched, my rest\nbroken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed\nnear me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters;\nno sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me.\_ Towards morning it\nrained; the whole of the following day was wet.\_ Do not ask me, reader,\nto give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as\nbefore, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my\nlips.\_ At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a\nmess of cold porridge into a pig trough.\_ “Will you give me that?” I\nasked.\n\n\n\nShe stared at me.\_ “Mother!” she exclaimed, “there is a woman wants me\nto give her these porridge.”\n\n“Well lass,” replied a voice within, “give it her if she’s a beggar.\_ T’\npig doesn’t want it.”\n\nThe girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it\nravenously.\n\nAs the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which\nI had been pursuing an hour or more.\n\n“My strength is quite failing me,” I said in a soliloquy.\_ “I feel I\ncannot go much farther.\_ Shall I be an outcast again this night?\_ While\nthe rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?\_\nI fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?\_ But it will be\nvery dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this\nsense of desolation—this total prostration of hope.\_ In all likelihood,\nthough, I should die before morning.\_ And why cannot I reconcile myself\nto the prospect of death?\_ Why do I struggle to retain a valueless\nlife?\_ Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to\ndie of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.\_\nOh, Providence! sustain me a little longer!\_ Aid!—direct me!”\n\nMy glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.\_ I saw I had\nstrayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.\_ The very\ncultivation surrounding it had disappeared.\_ I had, by cross-ways and\nby-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a\nfew fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they\nwere scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.\n\n“Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented\nroad,” I reflected.\_ “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens\nthere be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that\nthey should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper’s\ngrave.”\n\nTo the hill, then, I turned.\_ I reached it.\_ It remained now only to\nfind a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not\nsecure.\_ But all the surface of the waste looked level.\_ It showed no\nvariation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes;\nblack, where the dry soil bore only heath.\_ Dark as it was getting, I\ncould still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light\nand shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.\n\nMy eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,\nvanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in\namong the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.\_ “That is an\nignis fatuus,” was my first thought; and I expected it would soon\nvanish.\_ It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor\nadvancing.\_ “Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?” I questioned.\_ I\nwatched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish,\nso it did not enlarge.\_ “It may be a candle in a house,” I then\nconjectured; “but if so, I can never reach it.\_ It is much too far away:\nand were it within a yard of me, what would it avail?\_ I should but\nknock at the door to have it shut in my face.”\n\nAnd I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.\_ I\nlay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and\ndied moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to\nthe skin.\_ Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly\nnumbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;\nbut my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.\_ I rose ere\nlong.\n\nThe light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.\_ I\ntried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.\_ It\nled me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been\nimpassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the\nheight of summer.\_ Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my\nfaculties.\_ This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.\n\nHaving crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.\_ I\napproached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the\nlight, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of\ntrees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character\nof their forms and foliage through the gloom.\_ My star vanished as I\ndrew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it.\_ I put out my\nhand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones\nof a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and\nprickly hedge.\_ I groped on.\_ Again a whitish object gleamed before me:\nit was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.\_ On each\nside stood a sable bush-holly or yew.\n\nEntering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose\nto view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone\nnowhere.\_ All was obscurity.\_ Were the inmates retired to rest?\_ I\nfeared it must be so.\_ In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there\nshot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very\nsmall latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller\nby the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves\nclustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.\_\nThe aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had\nbeen deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray\nof foliage shooting over it, I could see all within.\_ I could see\nclearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut,\nwith pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance\nof a glowing peat-fire.\_ I could see a clock, a white deal table, some\nchairs.\_ The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table;\nand by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but\nscrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.\n\nI noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing\nextraordinary.\_ A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,\nsitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.\_ Two young,\ngraceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair,\nthe other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and\nbombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and\nfaces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of\none girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\n\nA strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!\_ Who were\nthey?\_ They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the\ntable; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and\ncultivation.\_ I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I\ngazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.\_ I cannot call\nthem handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each\nbent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.\_ A stand\nbetween them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which\nthey frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller\nbooks they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to\naid them in the task of translation.\_ This scene was as silent as if all\nthe figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so\nhushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock\ntick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the\nclick-click of the woman’s knitting-needles.\_ When, therefore, a voice\nbroke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.\n\n“Listen, Diana,” said one of the absorbed students; “Franz and old\nDaniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from\nwhich he has awakened in terror—listen!”\_ And in a low voice she read\nsomething, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in\nan unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin.\_ Whether it were Greek or\nGerman I could not tell.\n\n“That is strong,” she said, when she had finished: “I relish it.”\_ The\nother girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,\nwhile she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.\_ At a later\nday, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the\nline: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on\nsounding brass to me—conveying no meaning:—\n\n“‘Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.’\_ Good! good!”\nshe exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.\_ “There you have a\ndim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!\_ The line is worth a\nhundred pages of fustian.\_ ‘Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines\nZornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.’\_ I like it!”\n\nBoth were again silent.\n\n“Is there ony country where they talk i’ that way?” asked the old woman,\nlooking up from her knitting.\n\n“Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no\nother way.”\n\n“Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’ one t’other:\nand if either o’ ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?”\n\n“We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we\nare not as clever as you think us, Hannah.\_ We don’t speak German, and\nwe cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.”\n\n“And what good does it do you?”\n\n“We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say;\nand then we shall get more money than we do now.”\n\n“Varry like: but give ower studying; ye’ve done enough for to-night.”\n\n“I think we have: at least I’m tired.\_ Mary, are you?”\n\n“Mortally: after all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with no\nmaster but a lexicon.”\n\n“It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious\nDeutsch.\_ I wonder when St. John will come home.”\n\n“Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little\ngold watch she drew from her girdle).\_ It rains fast, Hannah: will you\nhave the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?”\n\nThe woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:\nsoon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\n\n“Ah, childer!” said she, “it fair troubles me to go into yond’ room now:\nit looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a corner.”\n\nShe wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked\nsad now.\n\n“But he is in a better place,” continued Hannah: “we shouldn’t wish him\nhere again.\_ And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.”\n\n“You say he never mentioned us?” inquired one of the ladies.\n\n“He hadn’t time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.\_ He\nhad been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and\nwhen Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o’ ye to be sent for, he\nfair laughed at him.\_ He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his\nhead the next day—that is, a fortnight sin’—and he went to sleep and\nniver wakened: he wor a’most stark when your brother went into t’\nchamber and fand him.\_ Ah, childer! that’s t’ last o’ t’ old stock—for\nye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them ‘at’s gone; for\nall your mother wor mich i’ your way, and a’most as book-learned.\_ She\nwor the pictur’ o’ ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.”\n\nI thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for\nsuch I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.\_ Both were fair\ncomplexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of\ndistinction and intelligence.\_ One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker\nthan the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it;\nMary’s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana’s duskier\ntresses covered her neck with thick curls.\_ The clock struck ten.\n\n“Ye’ll want your supper, I am sure,” observed Hannah; “and so will Mr.\nSt. John when he comes in.”\n\nAnd she proceeded to prepare the meal.\_ The ladies rose; they seemed\nabout to withdraw to the parlour.\_ Till this moment, I had been so\nintent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited\nin me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched\nposition: now it recurred to me.\_ More desolate, more desperate than\never, it seemed from contrast.\_ And how impossible did it appear to\ntouch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them\nbelieve in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a\nrest for my wanderings!\_ As I groped out the door, and knocked at it\nhesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera.\_ Hannah\nopened.\n\n“What do you want?” she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she\nsurveyed me by the light of the candle she held.\n\n“May I speak to your mistresses?” I said.\n\n“You had better tell me what you have to say to them.\_ Where do you come\nfrom?”\n\n“I am a stranger.”\n\n“What is your business here at this hour?”\n\n“I want a night’s shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of\nbread to eat.”\n\nDistrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah’s face.\_ “I’ll\ngive you a piece of bread,” she said, after a pause; “but we can’t take\nin a vagrant to lodge.\_ It isn’t likely.”\n\n“Do let me speak to your mistresses.”\n\n“No, not I.\_ What can they do for you?\_ You should not be roving about\nnow; it looks very ill.”\n\n“But where shall I go if you drive me away?\_ What shall I do?”\n\n“Oh, I’ll warrant you know where to go and what to do.\_ Mind you don’t\ndo wrong, that’s all.\_ Here is a penny; now go—”\n\n“A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.\_ Don’t\nshut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!”\n\n“I must; the rain is driving in—”\n\n“Tell the young ladies.\_ Let me see them—”\n\n“Indeed, I will not.\_ You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn’t\nmake such a noise.\_ Move off.”\n\n“But I must die if I am turned away.”\n\n“Not you.\_ I’m fear’d you have some ill plans agate, that bring you\nabout folk’s houses at this time o’ night.\_ If you’ve any\nfollowers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them we\nare not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and\nguns.”\_ Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and\nbolted it within.\n\nThis was the climax.\_ A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true\ndespair—rent and heaved my heart.\_ Worn out, indeed, I was; not another\nstep could I stir.\_ I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung my\nhands—I wept in utter anguish.\_ Oh, this spectre of death!\_ Oh, this\nlast hour, approaching in such horror!\_ Alas, this isolation—this\nbanishment from my kind!\_ Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing\nof fortitude was gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon\nendeavoured to regain.\n\n“I can but die,” I said, “and I believe in God.\_ Let me try to wait His\nwill in silence.”\n\nThese words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my\nmisery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there—dumb\nand still.\n\n“All men must die,” said a voice quite close at hand; “but all are not\ncondemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be\nif you perished here of want.”\n\n“Who or what speaks?” I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and\nincapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.\_ A form was\nnear—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented\nme from distinguishing.\_ With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed\nto the door.\n\n“Is it you, Mr. St. John?” cried Hannah.\n\n“Yes—yes; open quickly.”\n\n“Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!\_ Come\nin—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad\nfolks about.\_ There has been a beggar-woman—I declare she is not gone\nyet!—laid down there.\_ Get up! for shame!\_ Move off, I say!”\n\n“Hush, Hannah!\_ I have a word to say to the woman.\_ You have done your\nduty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.\_ I was near, and\nlistened to both you and her.\_ I think this is a peculiar case—I must at\nleast examine into it.\_ Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the\nhouse.”\n\n\n\nWith difficulty I obeyed him.\_ Presently I stood within that clean,\nbright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an\naspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.\_ The two\nladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at\nme.\n\n“St. John, who is it?” I heard one ask.\n\n“I cannot tell: I found her at the door,” was the reply.\n\n“She does look white,” said Hannah.\n\n“As white as clay or death,” was responded.\_ “She will fall: let her\nsit.”\n\nAnd indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.\_ I still\npossessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.\n\n“Perhaps a little water would restore her.\_ Hannah, fetch some.\_ But she\nis worn to nothing.\_ How very thin, and how very bloodless!”\n\n“A mere spectre!”\n\n“Is she ill, or only famished?”\n\n“Famished, I think.\_ Hannah, is that milk?\_ Give it me, and a piece of\nbread.”\n\nDiana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and\nthe fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and\nput it to my lips.\_ Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,\nand I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.\_ In her simple words, too,\nthe same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to eat.”\n\n“Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary’s hand removed my sodden\nbonnet and lifted my head.\_ I tasted what they offered me: feebly at\nfirst, eagerly soon.\n\n“Not too much at first—restrain her,” said the brother; “she has had\nenough.”\_ And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.\n\n“A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes.”\n\n“No more at present, sister.\_ Try if she can speak now—ask her her\nname.”\n\nI felt I could speak, and I answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.”\_ Anxious\nas ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an\nalias.\n\n“And where do you live?\_ Where are your friends?”\n\nI was silent.\n\n“Can we send for any one you know?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“What account can you give of yourself?”\n\nSomehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and\nonce was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,\nvagrant, and disowned by the wide world.\_ I dared to put off the\nmendicant—to resume my natural manner and character.\_ I began once more\nto know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at\npresent I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—\n\n“Sir, I can give you no details to-night.”\n\n“But what, then,” said he, “do you expect me to do for you?”\n\n“Nothing,” I replied.\_ My strength sufficed for but short answers.\_\nDiana took the word—\n\n“Do you mean,” she asked, “that we have now given you what aid you\nrequire? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?”\n\nI looked at her.\_ She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct\nboth with power and goodness.\_ I took sudden courage.\_ Answering her\ncompassionate gaze with a smile, I said—“I will trust you.\_ If I were a\nmasterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your\nhearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.\_ Do with me and for me\nas you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I feel\na spasm when I speak.”\_ All three surveyed me, and all three were\nsilent.\n\n“Hannah,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let her sit there at present, and\nask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of\nthat milk and bread.\_ Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and\ntalk the matter over.”\n\nThey withdrew.\_ Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell\nwhich.\_ A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the\ngenial fire.\_ In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.\_ Ere\nlong, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my\ndripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.\_ I\nthanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful\njoy—and slept.\n"
