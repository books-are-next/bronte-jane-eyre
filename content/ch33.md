title: "\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nMy home, then, when I at last find a home,—is a cottage; a little room\nwith whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted\nchairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and\ndishes, and a set of tea-things in delf.\_ Above, a chamber of the same\ndimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers;\nsmall, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the\nkindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a\nmodest stock of such things as are necessary.\n\nIt is evening.\_ I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little\norphan who serves me as a handmaid.\_ I am sitting alone on the hearth.\_\nThis morning, the village school opened.\_ I had twenty scholars.\_ But\nthree of the number can read: none write or cipher.\_ Several knit, and a\nfew sew a little.\_ They speak with the broadest accent of the district.\_\nAt present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other’s\nlanguage.\_ Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as\nignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a\ndisposition that pleases me.\_ I must not forget that these coarsely-clad\nlittle peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest\ngenealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,\nintelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in\nthose of the best-born.\_ My duty will be to develop these germs: surely\nI shall find some happiness in discharging that office.\_ Much enjoyment\nI do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless,\nif I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough\nto live on from day to day.\n\nWas I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in\nyonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?\_ Not to\ndeceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree.\_ I\nfelt—yes, idiot that I am—I felt degraded.\_ I doubted I had taken a step\nwhich sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.\_ I\nwas weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all\nI heard and saw round me.\_ But let me not hate and despise myself too\nmuch for these feelings; I know them to be wrong—that is a great step\ngained; I shall strive to overcome them.\_ To-morrow, I trust, I shall\nget the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will\nbe quite subdued.\_ In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of\nseeing progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may\nsubstitute gratification for disgust.\n\nMeantime, let me ask myself one question—Which is better?—To have\nsurrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful\neffort—no struggle;—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen\nasleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst\nthe luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.\nRochester’s mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he\nwould—oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.\_ He did love\nme—no one will ever love me so again.\_ I shall never more know the sweet\nhomage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else shall\nI seem to possess these charms.\_ He was fond and proud of me—it is what\nno man besides will ever be.—But where am I wandering, and what am I\nsaying, and above all, feeling?\_ Whether is it better, I ask, to be a\nslave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss one\nhour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the\nnext—or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy\nmountain nook in the healthy heart of England?\n\nYes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law,\nand scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.\_ God\ndirected me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the\nguidance!\n\nHaving brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my\ndoor, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet\nfields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a\nmile from the village.\_ The birds were singing their last strains—\n\n“The air was mild, the dew was balm.”\n\n\nWhile I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself\nere long weeping—and why?\_ For the doom which had reft me from adhesion\nto my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and\nfatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now, perhaps, be\ndragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate\nrestoration thither.\_ At this thought, I turned my face aside from the\nlovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say lonely, for in\nthat bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the\nchurch and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the\nextremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his\ndaughter lived.\_ I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone\nframe of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in\nmy tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.\_ A dog—old\nCarlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing the gate\nwith his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his\nbrow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me.\_ I asked\nhim to come in.\n\n“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters\nleft for you.\_ I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”\n\nI approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.\_ He examined my face, I\nthought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were\ndoubtless very visible upon it.\n\n“Have you found your first day’s work harder than you expected?” he\nasked.\n\n“Oh, no!\_ On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my\nscholars very well.”\n\n“But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture—have\ndisappointed your expectations?\_ They are, in truth, scanty enough;\nbut—” I interrupted—\n\n“My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and\ncommodious.\_ All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.\_ I am not\nabsolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a\ncarpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had\nnothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance,\na home, a business.\_ I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of\nmy friends; the bounty of my lot.\_ I do not repine.”\n\n“But you feel solitude an oppression?\_ The little house there behind you\nis dark and empty.”\n\n“I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less\nto grow impatient under one of loneliness.”\n\n“Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your\ngood sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the\nvacillating fears of Lot’s wife.\_ What you had left before I saw you, of\ncourse I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every\ntemptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present\ncareer steadily, for some months at least.”\n\n“It is what I mean to do,” I answered.\_ St. John continued—\n\n“It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the\nbent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.\_ God\nhas given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our\nenergies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our will\nstrains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from\ninanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another\nnourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to\ntaste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road\nas direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if\nrougher than it.\n\n“A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had\nmade a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me\nto death.\_ I burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more\nexciting toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist,\nauthor, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of\na politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a\nluster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice.\_ I considered; my\nlife was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.\_ After a season\nof darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped\nexistence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds—my powers\nheard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread\ntheir wings, and mount beyond ken.\_ God had an errand for me; to bear\nwhich afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and\neloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,\nwere all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.\n\n“A missionary I resolved to be.\_ From that moment my state of mind\nchanged; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving\nnothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal.\_\nMy father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I\nhave not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a\nsuccessor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings\nbroken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in\nwhich I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I will\novercome—and I leave Europe for the East.”\n\nHe said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking,\nwhen he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which\nI looked too.\_ Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up\nthe field to the wicket.\_ We had heard no step on that grass-grown\ntrack; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the\nhour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a\nsilver bell, exclaimed—\n\n“Good evening, Mr. Rivers.\_ And good evening, old Carlo.\_ Your dog is\nquicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears\nand wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have\nyour back towards me now.”\n\nIt was true.\_ Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those\nmusical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he\nstood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which\nthe speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his face\ndirected towards the west.\_ He turned at last, with measured\ndeliberation.\_ A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.\_\nThere appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a\nyouthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after\nbending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long\nveil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.\_ Perfect\nbeauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as\nsweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure\nhues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies\ngenerated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.\_ No charm\nwas wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and\ndelicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely\npictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which\nencircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow\nwhich gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such\nrepose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh,\nand smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the\neven and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the\nornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which,\ncombined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.\_ I wondered, as\nI looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.\_\nNature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her\nusual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling,\nwith a grand-dame’s bounty.\n\nWhat did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?\_ I naturally asked\nmyself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as\nnaturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.\_ He\nhad already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble\ntuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.\n\n“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he\ncrushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.\n\n“Oh, I only came home from S-” (she mentioned the name of a large town\nsome twenty miles distant) “this afternoon.\_ Papa told me you had opened\nyour school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my\nbonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?”\npointing to me.\n\n“It is,” said St. John.\n\n“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct and\nnaive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.\n\n“I hope I shall.\_ I have many inducements to do so.”\n\n“Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?”\n\n“Quite.”\n\n“Do you like your house?”\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“Have I furnished it nicely?”\n\n“Very nicely, indeed.”\n\n“And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”\n\n“You have indeed.\_ She is teachable and handy.”\_ (This then, I thought,\nis Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of\nfortune, as well as in those of nature!\_ What happy combination of the\nplanets presided over her birth, I wonder?)\n\n“I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” she added.\_ “It will\nbe a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.\_ Mr.\nRivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S-.\_ Last night, or\nrather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock.\_ The ---th regiment\nare stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most\nagreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and\nscissor merchants to shame.”\n\nIt seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper\nlip curled a moment.\_ His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,\nand the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the\nlaughing girl gave him this information.\_ He lifted his gaze, too, from\nthe daisies, and turned it on her.\_ An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning\ngaze it was.\_ She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well\nbecame her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.\n\nAs he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.\_ “Poor\nCarlo loves me,” said she.\_ “He is not stern and distant to his\nfriends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”\n\nAs she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his young\nand austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face.\_ I saw his\nsolemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.\_\nFlushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she\nfor a woman.\_ His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of\ndespotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a\nvigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.\_ But he curbed it, I\nthink, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.\_ He responded\nneither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.\n\n“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver, looking\nup.\_ “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.\_ He is alone this evening,\nand not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”\n\n“It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St.\nJohn.\n\n“Not a seasonable hour!\_ But I declare it is.\_ It is just the hour when\npapa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no\nbusiness to occupy him.\_ Now, Mr. Rivers, do come.\_ Why are you so\nvery shy, and so very sombre?”\_ She filled up the hiatus his silence\nleft by a reply of her own.\n\n“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if\nshocked at herself.\_ “I am so giddy and thoughtless!\_ Do excuse me.\_\nIt had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for\njoining in my chatter.\_ Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is\nshut up, and you are so lonely.\_ I am sure I pity you.\_ Do come and see\npapa.”\n\n“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”\n\nMr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the\neffort it cost him thus to refuse.\n\n“Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay\nany longer: the dew begins to fall.\_ Good evening!”\n\nShe held out her hand.\_ He just touched it.\_ “Good evening!” he\nrepeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo.\_ She turned, but in a\nmoment returned.\n\n“Are you well?” she asked.\_ Well might she put the question: his face\nwas blanched as her gown.\n\n“Quite well,” he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.\_ She\nwent one way; he another.\_ She turned twice to gaze after him as she\ntripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never\nturned at all.\n\nThis spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts\nfrom exclusive meditation on my own.\_ Diana Rivers had designated her\nbrother “inexorable as death.”\_ She had not exaggerated.\n"
