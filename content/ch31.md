title: "\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very\ndim in my mind.\_ I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but\nfew thoughts framed, and no actions performed.\_ I knew I was in a small\nroom and in a narrow bed.\_ To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on\nit motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been\nalmost to kill me.\_ I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change\nfrom morning to noon, from noon to evening.\_ I observed when any one\nentered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could\nunderstand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could\nnot answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.\_\nHannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.\_ Her coming disturbed\nme.\_ I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not\nunderstand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.\_\nDiana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.\_ They would\nwhisper sentences of this sort at my bedside—\n\n“It is very well we took her in.”\n\n“Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the\nmorning had she been left out all night.\_ I wonder what she has gone\nthrough?”\n\n“Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?”\n\n“She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of\nspeaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off,\nthough splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.”\n\n“She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like\nit; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy\nwould be agreeable.”\n\nNever once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the\nhospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,\nmyself.\_ I was comforted.\n\nMr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of\nlethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted\nfatigue.\_ He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was\nsure, would manage best, left to herself.\_ He said every nerve had been\noverstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a\nwhile.\_ There was no disease.\_ He imagined my recovery would be rapid\nenough when once commenced.\_ These opinions he delivered in a few words,\nin a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man\nlittle accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual physiognomy;\ncertainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.”\n\n“Far otherwise,” responded Diana.\_ “To speak truth, St. John, my heart\nrather warms to the poor little soul.\_ I wish we may be able to benefit\nher permanently.”\n\n“That is hardly likely,” was the reply.\_ “You will find she is some\nyoung lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has\nprobably injudiciously left them.\_ We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring\nher to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her\nface which make me sceptical of her tractability.”\_ He stood considering\nme some minutes; then added, “She looks sensible, but not at all\nhandsome.”\n\n“She is so ill, St. John.”\n\n“Ill or well, she would always be plain.\_ The grace and harmony of\nbeauty are quite wanting in those features.”\n\nOn the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise\nin bed, and turn.\_ Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast,\nabout, as I supposed, the dinner-hour.\_ I had eaten with relish: the\nfood was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned\nwhat I had swallowed.\_ When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and\nrevived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.\_ I\nwished to rise; but what could I put on?\_ Only my damp and bemired\napparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.\_ I\nfelt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad.\_ I was spared the\nhumiliation.\n\nOn a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.\_ My\nblack silk frock hung against the wall.\_ The traces of the bog were\nremoved from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite\ndecent.\_ My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered\npresentable.\_ There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb\nand brush to smooth my hair.\_ After a weary process, and resting every\nfive minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.\_ My clothes hung loose on\nme; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and\nonce more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace\nof the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—I\ncrept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow\nlow passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.\n\nIt was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous\nfire.\_ Hannah was baking.\_ Prejudices, it is well known, are most\ndifficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened\nor fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among\nstones.\_ Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly\nshe had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and\nwell-dressed, she even smiled.\n\n“What, you have got up!” she said.\_ “You are better, then.\_ You may sit\nyou down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.”\n\nShe pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.\_ She bustled about,\nexamining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.\_ Turning to\nme, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—\n\n“Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?”\n\nI was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the\nquestion, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered\nquietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—\n\n“You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.\_ I am no beggar; any more\nthan yourself or your young ladies.”\n\nAfter a pause she said, “I dunnut understand that: you’ve like no house,\nnor no brass, I guess?”\n\n“The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not\nmake a beggar in your sense of the word.”\n\n“Are you book-learned?” she inquired presently.\n\n“Yes, very.”\n\n“But you’ve never been to a boarding-school?”\n\n“I was at a boarding-school eight years.”\n\nShe opened her eyes wide.\_ “Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?”\n\n“I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.\_ What are\nyou going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as she brought out\na basket of the fruit.\n\n“Mak’ ’em into pies.”\n\n“Give them to me and I’ll pick them.”\n\n“Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.”\n\n“But I must do something.\_ Let me have them.”\n\nShe consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my\ndress, “lest,” as she said, “I should mucky it.”\n\n“Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by your hands,” she\nremarked.\_ “Happen ye’ve been a dressmaker?”\n\n“No, you are wrong.\_ And now, never mind what I have been: don’t trouble\nyour head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we\nare.”\n\n“Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.”\n\n“And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?”\n\n“Nay; he doesn’t live here: he is only staying a while.\_ When he is at\nhome, he is in his own parish at Morton.”\n\n“That village a few miles off?\n\n“Aye.”\n\n“And what is he?”\n\n“He is a parson.”\n\nI remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I\nhad asked to see the clergyman.\_ “This, then, was his father’s\nresidence?”\n\n“Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and\ngurt (great) grandfather afore him.”\n\n“The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?”\n\n“Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.”\n\n“And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Their father is dead?”\n\n“Dead three weeks sin’ of a stroke.”\n\n“They have no mother?”\n\n“The mistress has been dead this mony a year.”\n\n“Have you lived with the family long?”\n\n“I’ve lived here thirty year.\_ I nursed them all three.”\n\n“That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.\_ I will\nsay so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a\nbeggar.”\n\nShe again regarded me with a surprised stare.\_ “I believe,” she said, “I\nwas quite mista’en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats\ngoes about, you mun forgie me.”\n\n“And though,” I continued, rather severely, “you wished to turn me from\nthe door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.”\n\n“Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?\_ I thought more o’ th’\nchilder nor of mysel: poor things!\_ They’ve like nobody to tak’ care on\n’em but me.\_ I’m like to look sharpish.”\n\nI maintained a grave silence for some minutes.\n\n“You munnut think too hardly of me,” she again remarked.\n\n“But I do think hardly of you,” I said; “and I’ll tell you why—not so\nmuch because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an\nimpostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I\nhad no ‘brass’ and no house.\_ Some of the best people that ever lived\nhave been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought\nnot to consider poverty a crime.”\n\n“No more I ought,” said she: “Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I\nwor wrang—but I’ve clear a different notion on you now to what I had.\_\nYou look a raight down dacent little crater.”\n\n“That will do—I forgive you now.\_ Shake hands.”\n\nShe put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile\nillumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.\n\nHannah was evidently fond of talking.\_ While I picked the fruit, and she\nmade the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details\nabout her deceased master and mistress, and “the childer,” as she called\nthe young people.\n\nOld Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and\nof as ancient a family as could be found.\_ Marsh End had belonged to the\nRivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, “aboon two\nhundred year old—for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to\ncompare wi’ Mr. Oliver’s grand hall down i’ Morton Vale.\_ But she could\nremember Bill Oliver’s father a journeyman needlemaker; and th’ Rivers\nwor gentry i’ th’ owd days o’ th’ Henrys, as onybody might see by\nlooking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.”\_ Still, she\nallowed, “the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o’ t’\ncommon way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich like.”\_ The\nmistress was different.\_ She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and\nthe “bairns” had taken after her.\_ There was nothing like them in these\nparts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost\nfrom the time they could speak; and they had always been “of a mak’ of\ntheir own.”\_ Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a\nparson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as\ngovernesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago lost\na great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as\nhe was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for\nthemselves.\_ They had lived very little at home for a long while, and\nwere only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father’s\ndeath; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors\nand hills about.\_ They had been in London, and many other grand towns;\nbut they always said there was no place like home; and then they were so\nagreeable with each other—never fell out nor “threaped.”\_ She did not\nknow where there was such a family for being united.\n\nHaving finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two\nladies and their brother were now.\n\n“Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour\nto tea.”\n\nThey returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by\nthe kitchen door.\_ Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed\nthrough; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly\nexpressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to\ncome down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.\n\n“You should have waited for my leave to descend,” she said.\_ “You still\nlook very pale—and so thin!\_ Poor child!—poor girl!”\n\nDiana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.\_ She\npossessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.\_ Her whole face\nseemed to me full of charm.\_ Mary’s countenance was equally\nintelligent—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more\nreserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.\_ Diana looked\nand spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.\_ It was\nmy nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like\nhers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an\nactive will.\n\n“And what business have you here?” she continued.\_ “It is not your\nplace.\_ Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like\nto be free, even to license—but you are a visitor, and must go into the\nparlour.”\n\n“I am very well here.”\n\n“Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.”\n\n“Besides, the fire is too hot for you,” interposed Mary.\n\n“To be sure,” added her sister.\_ “Come, you must be obedient.”\_ And\nstill holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.\n\n“Sit there,” she said, placing me on the sofa, “while we take our things\noff and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our\nlittle moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,\nor when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.”\n\nShe closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat\nopposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.\_ I examined first, the\nparlour, and then its occupant.\n\nThe parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet\ncomfortable, because clean and neat.\_ The old-fashioned chairs were very\nbright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.\_ A few\nstrange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated\nthe stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and\nan ancient set of china.\_ There was no superfluous ornament in the\nroom—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a\nlady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:\neverything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn\nand well saved.\n\nMr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,\nkeeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely\nsealed—was easy enough to examine.\_ Had he been a statue instead of a\nman, he could not have been easier.\_ He was young—perhaps from\ntwenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was\nlike a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose;\nquite an Athenian mouth and chin.\_ It is seldom, indeed, an English face\ncomes so near the antique models as did his.\_ He might well be a little\nshocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so\nharmonious.\_ His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high\nforehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless\nlocks of fair hair.\n\nThis is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?\_ Yet he whom it\ndescribes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,\nan impressible, or even of a placid nature.\_ Quiescent as he now sat,\nthere was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my\nperceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or\neager.\_ He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one\nglance, till his sisters returned.\_ Diana, as she passed in and out, in\nthe course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top\nof the oven.\n\n“Eat that now,” she said: “you must be hungry.\_ Hannah says you have had\nnothing but some gruel since breakfast.”\n\nI did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.\_ Mr. Rivers\nnow closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed\nhis blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.\_ There was an unceremonious\ndirectness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which\ntold that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted\nfrom the stranger.\n\n“You are very hungry,” he said.\n\n“I am, sir.”\_ It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to\nmeet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\n\n“It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the\nlast three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the\ncravings of your appetite at first.\_ Now you may eat, though still not\nimmoderately.”\n\n“I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,” was my very\nclumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.\n\n“No,” he said coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of\nyour friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.”\n\n“That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being\nabsolutely without home and friends.”\n\nThe three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no\nsuspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.\_ I speak\nparticularly of the young ladies.\_ St. John’s eyes, though clear enough\nin a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.\_ He\nseemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people’s\nthoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of\nkeenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than\nto encourage.\n\n“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you are completely isolated from\nevery connection?”\n\n“I do.\_ Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess\nto admittance under any roof in England.”\n\n“A most singular position at your age!”\n\nHere I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the\ntable before me.\_ I wondered what he sought there: his words soon\nexplained the quest.\n\n“You have never been married?\_ You are a spinster?”\n\nDiana laughed.\_ “Why, she can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years\nold, St. John,” said she.\n\n“I am near nineteen: but I am not married.\_ No.”\n\nI felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating\nrecollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.\_ They all saw\nthe embarrassment and the emotion.\_ Diana and Mary relieved me by\nturning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder\nand sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited\nforced out tears as well as colour.\n\n“Where did you last reside?” he now asked.\n\n“You are too inquisitive, St. John,” murmured Mary in a low voice; but\nhe leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and\npiercing look.\n\n“The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my\nsecret,” I replied concisely.\n\n“Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from\nSt. John and every other questioner,” remarked Diana.\n\n“Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,” he\nsaid.\_ “And you need help, do you not?”\n\n“I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist\nwill put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the\nremuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of\nlife.”\n\n“I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid\nyou to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.\_ First, then, tell\nme what you have been accustomed to do, and what you can do.”\n\nI had now swallowed my tea.\_ I was mightily refreshed by the beverage;\nas much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves,\nand enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.\n\n“Mr. Rivers,” I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked\nat me, openly and without diffidence, “you and your sisters have done me\na great service—the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have\nrescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death.\_ This benefit\nconferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to\na certain extent, on my confidence.\_ I will tell you as much of the\nhistory of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without\ncompromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical,\nand that of others.\n\n“I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.\_ My parents died before I\ncould know them.\_ I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable\ninstitution.\_ I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where\nI passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan\nAsylum, ---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert\nBrocklehurst is the treasurer.”\n\n“I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.”\n\n“I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.\_ I\nobtained a good situation, and was happy.\_ This place I was obliged to\nleave four days before I came here.\_ The reason of my departure I cannot\nand ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would\nsound incredible.\_ No blame attached to me: I am as free from\nculpability as any one of you three.\_ Miserable I am, and must be for a\ntime; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a\nparadise was of a strange and direful nature.\_ I observed but two points\nin planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave\nbehind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my\nhurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that\nbrought me to Whitcross.\_ To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite\ndestitute.\_ I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two\ndays without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I\ntaste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair\nalmost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of\nwant at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.\_ I know\nall your sisters have done for me since—for I have not been insensible\nduring my seeming torpor—and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial\ncompassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.”\n\n“Don’t make her talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as I paused;\n“she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.\_ Come to the sofa and sit\ndown now, Miss Elliott.”\n\nI gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias: I had\nforgotten my new name.\_ Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,\nnoticed it at once.\n\n“You said your name was Jane Elliott?” he observed.\n\n“I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be\ncalled at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it\nsounds strange to me.”\n\n“Your real name you will not give?”\n\n“No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would\nlead to it, I avoid.”\n\n“You are quite right, I am sure,” said Diana.\_ “Now do, brother, let her\nbe at peace a while.”\n\nBut when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as\nimperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.\n\n“You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you would\nwish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters’ compassion,\nand, above all, with my charity (I am quite sensible of the\ndistinction drawn, nor do I resent it—it is just): you desire to be\nindependent of us?”\n\n“I do: I have already said so.\_ Show me how to work, or how to seek\nwork: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest\ncottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of\nthe horrors of homeless destitution.”\n\n“Indeed you shall stay here,” said Diana, putting her white hand on my\nhead.\_ “You shall,” repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative\nsincerity which seemed natural to her.\n\n“My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,” said Mr. St.\nJohn, “as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a\nhalf-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their\ncasement.\_ I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping\nyourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is\nnarrow.\_ I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be\nof the humblest sort.\_ And if you are inclined to despise the day of\nsmall things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can\noffer.”\n\n“She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can\ndo,” answered Diana for me; “and you know, St. John, she has no choice\nof helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.”\n\n“I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a\nservant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,” I answered.\n\n“Right,” said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.\_ “If such is your spirit, I\npromise to aid you, in my own time and way.”\n\nHe now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.\_ I\nsoon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my\npresent strength would permit.\n"
