title: "\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nThe promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to\nThornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer\nacquaintance with the place and its inmates.\_ Mrs. Fairfax turned out to\nbe what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of\ncompetent education and average intelligence.\_ My pupil was a lively\nchild, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes\nwayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no\ninjudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her\nimprovement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and\nteachable.\_ She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no\npeculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above\nthe ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or\nvice which sunk her below it.\_ She made reasonable progress, entertained\nfor me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by\nher simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in\nreturn, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content\nin each other’s society.\n\nThis, par parenthèse, will be thought cool language by persons who\nentertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the\nduty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an\nidolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism,\nto echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.\_ I felt\na conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a quiet\nliking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a\nthankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society\nproportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation\nof her mind and character.\n\nAnybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,\nwhen I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the\ngates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle\nplayed with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I\nclimbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and\nhaving reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and\nhill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision\nwhich might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,\ntowns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I\ndesired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of\nintercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,\nthan was here within my reach.\_ I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,\nand what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other and\nmore vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.\n\nWho blames me?\_ Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.\_ I\ncould not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to\npain sometimes.\_ Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of\nthe third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and\nsolitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever\nbright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and\nglowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which,\nwhile it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all,\nto open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my\nimagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of\nincident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual\nexistence.\n\nIt is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with\ntranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they\ncannot find it.\_ Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and\nmillions are in silent revolt against their lot.\_ Nobody knows how many\nrebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life\nwhich people earth.\_ Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but\nwomen feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and\na field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer\nfrom too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men\nwould suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged\nfellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making\npuddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and\nembroidering bags.\_ It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them,\nif they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced\nnecessary for their sex.\n\nWhen thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh: the same\npeal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled\nme: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.\_ There\nwere days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could\nnot account for the sounds she made.\_ Sometimes I saw her: she would\ncome out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go\ndown to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,\nforgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.\_ Her\nappearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral\noddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest\ncould attach.\_ I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but\nshe seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short\nevery effort of that sort.\n\nThe other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the\nhousemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no\nrespect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I\nasked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a\ndescriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and\nconfused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage\ninquiry.\n\nOctober, November, December passed away.\_ One afternoon in January, Mrs.\nFairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as\nAdèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious\noccasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,\ndeeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.\_ It was a\nfine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the\nlibrary through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a\nletter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak\nand volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a\npleasant winter afternoon walk.\_ Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in\nher little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and given her her\nbest wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a\ndrawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and\nhaving replied to her “Revenez bientôt, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle.\nJeannette,” with a kiss I set out.\n\nThe ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked\nfast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the\nspecies of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.\_ It was\nthree o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the\ncharm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and\npale-beaming sun.\_ I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for\nwild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now\npossessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter\ndelight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.\_ If a breath of\nair stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an\nevergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as\nstill as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the\npath.\_ Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no\ncattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred\noccasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had\nforgotten to drop.\n\nThis lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the\nmiddle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.\_ Gathering\nmy mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel\nthe cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice\ncovering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had\noverflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.\_ From my seat I could\nlook down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the\nprincipal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose\nagainst the west.\_ I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees,\nand sank crimson and clear behind them.\_ I then turned eastward.\n\nOn the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but\nbrightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,\nsent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,\nbut in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.\_\nMy ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could\nnot tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks\nthreading their passes.\_ That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of\nthe nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.\n\nA rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so\nfar away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,\nwhich effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass\nof a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong\non the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill, sunny\nhorizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.\n\nThe din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the\nlane yet hid it, but it approached.\_ I was just leaving the stile; yet,\nas the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.\_ In those days I\nwas young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind:\nthe memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and\nwhen they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness\nbeyond what childhood could give.\_ As this horse approached, and as I\nwatched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of\nBessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a\n“Gytrash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted\nsolitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse\nwas now coming upon me.\n\nIt was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,\ntramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems\nglided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct\nobject against the trees.\_ It was exactly one form of Bessie’s Gytrash—a\nlion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me,\nhowever, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange\npretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.\_ The horse\nfollowed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider.\_ The man, the human\nbeing, broke the spell at once.\_ Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was\nalways alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the\ndumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace\nhuman form.\_ No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut\nto Millcote.\_ He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a\nsliding sound and an exclamation of “What the deuce is to do now?” and a\nclattering tumble, arrested my attention.\_ Man and horse were down; they\nhad slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.\_ The dog came\nbounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the\nhorse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was\ndeep in proportion to his magnitude.\_ He snuffed round the prostrate\ngroup, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no\nother help at hand to summon.\_ I obeyed him, and walked down to the\ntraveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed.\_ His\nefforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I\nasked him the question—\n\n“Are you injured, sir?”\n\nI think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing\nsome formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.\n\n“Can I do anything?” I asked again.\n\n“You must just stand on one side,” he answered as he rose, first to his\nknees, and then to his feet.\_ I did; whereupon began a heaving,\nstamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which\nremoved me effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven\nquite away till I saw the event.\_ This was finally fortunate; the horse\nwas re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down, Pilot!”\_ The\ntraveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether\nthey were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the\nstile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\n\nI was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for\nI now drew near him again.\n\n“If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from\nThornfield Hall or from Hay.”\n\n“Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;” and\nagain he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an\ninvoluntary “Ugh!”\n\nSomething of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I\ncould see him plainly.\_ His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur\ncollared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced\nthe general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.\_\nHe had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and\ngathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past\nyouth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.\_\nI felt no fear of him, and but little shyness.\_ Had he been a handsome,\nheroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus\nquestioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.\_ I\nhad hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.\_\nI had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance,\ngallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in\nmasculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had\nnor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned\nthem as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but\nantipathetic.\n\nIf even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I\naddressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with\nthanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew\ninquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my\nease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—\n\n“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this\nsolitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.”\n\nHe looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my\ndirection before.\n\n“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,” said he, “if you have\na home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?”\n\n“From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it\nis moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish\nit: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.”\n\n“You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?”\npointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,\nbringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with\nthe western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Whose house is it?”\n\n“Mr. Rochester’s.”\n\n“Do you know Mr. Rochester?”\n\n“No, I have never seen him.”\n\n“He is not resident, then?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Can you tell me where he is?”\n\n“I cannot.”\n\n“You are not a servant at the hall, of course.\_ You are—”\_ He stopped,\nran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black\nmerino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough\nfor a lady’s-maid.\_ He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped\nhim.\n\n“I am the governess.”\n\n“Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “deuce take me, if I had not\nforgotten!\_ The governess!” and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.\_ In\ntwo minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he\ntried to move.\n\n“I cannot commission you to fetch help,” he said; “but you may help me a\nlittle yourself, if you will be so kind.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Try to get hold of my horse’s bridle and lead him to me: you are not\nafraid?”\n\nI should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to\ndo it, I was disposed to obey.\_ I put down my muff on the stile, and\nwent up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was\na spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort\non effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its\ntrampling fore-feet.\_ The traveller waited and watched for some time,\nand at last he laughed.\n\n\n\n“I see,” he said, “the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all\nyou can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to\ncome here.”\n\nI came.\_ “Excuse me,” he continued: “necessity compels me to make you\nuseful.”\_ He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with\nsome stress, limped to his horse.\_ Having once caught the bridle, he\nmastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he\nmade the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.\n\n“Now,” said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, “just hand me\nmy whip; it lies there under the hedge.”\n\nI sought it and found it.\n\n“Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as\nyou can.”\n\nA touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then\nbound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,\n\n“Like heath that, in the wilderness,\n The wild wind whirls away.”\n\n\nI took up my muff and walked on.\_ The incident had occurred and was gone\nfor me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a\nsense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.\_\nMy help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to\nhave done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet\nan active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.\_ The new\nface, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory;\nand it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because\nit was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and\nstern.\_ I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the\nletter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the\nway home.\_ When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round\nand listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring on the\ncauseway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like\nNewfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a\npollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the\nmoonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among\nthe trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in\nthe direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a\nlight kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I\nhurried on.\n\nI did not like re-entering Thornfield.\_ To pass its threshold was to\nreturn to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome\nstaircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil\nMrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,\nwas to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip\nagain over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still\nexistence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I\nwas becoming incapable of appreciating.\_ What good it would have done me\nat that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain\nstruggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience\nto long for the calm amidst which I now repined!\_ Yes, just as much good\nas it would do a man tired of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to\ntake a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my\ncircumstances, as it would be under his.\n\nI lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and\nforwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I\ncould not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed\ndrawn from the gloomy house—from the grey-hollow filled with rayless\ncells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea\nabsolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her\norb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she\nhad come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight\ndark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those\ntrembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my\nveins glow when I viewed them.\_ Little things recall us to earth; the\nclock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars,\nopened a side-door, and went in.\n\nThe hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze\nlamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak\nstaircase.\_ This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose\ntwo-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate,\nglancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple\ndraperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.\_ It\nrevealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it,\nand scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst\nwhich I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.\n\nI hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no\ncandle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.\_ Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the\nrug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and\nwhite long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.\_ It was so\nlike it that I went forward and said—“Pilot” and the thing got up and\ncame to me and snuffed me.\_ I caressed him, and he wagged his great\ntail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not\ntell whence he had come.\_ I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I\nwanted, too, to get an account of this visitant.\_ Leah entered.\n\n“What dog is this?”\n\n“He came with master.”\n\n“With whom?”\n\n“With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived.”\n\n“Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?”\n\n“Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for\na surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle\nis sprained.”\n\n“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?”\n\n“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.”\n\n“Ah!\_ Bring me a candle will you Leah?”\n\nLeah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the\nnews; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.\nRochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went\nupstairs to take off my things.\n"
