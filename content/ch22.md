title: "\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nI had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let\ndown my window-blind.\_ The consequence was, that when the moon, which\nwas full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that\nspace in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the\nunveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.\_ Awaking in the dead of\nnight, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal clear.\_ It\nwas beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw\nthe curtain.\n\nGood God!\_ What a cry!\n\nThe night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,\na shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.\n\nMy pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.\_\nThe cry died, and was not renewed.\_ Indeed, whatever being uttered that\nfearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on\nthe Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the\ncloud shrouding his eyrie.\_ The thing delivering such utterance must\nrest ere it could repeat the effort.\n\nIt came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.\_ And\noverhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a\nstruggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered\nvoice shouted—\n\n“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.\n\n“Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and\nstamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—\n\n“Rochester!\_ Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”\n\nA chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.\_\nAnother step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there\nwas silence.\n\nI had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued\nfrom my apartment.\_ The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,\nterrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one\nlooked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.\_ Gentlemen and\nladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is\nhurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there\nrobbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.\_\nBut for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.\_ They\nran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the\nconfusion was inextricable.\n\n“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent.\_ “I cannot find him\nin his bed.”\n\n“Here! here!” was shouted in return.\_ “Be composed, all of you: I’m\ncoming.”\n\nAnd the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester\nadvanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.\_\nOne of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss\nIngram.\n\n“What awful event has taken place?” said she.\_ “Speak! let us know the\nworst at once!”\n\n“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses\nEshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white\nwrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.\n\n“All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried.\_ “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much\nAdo about Nothing.\_ Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”\n\nAnd dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.\_ Calming himself\nby an effort, he added—\n\n“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.\_ She’s an excitable,\nnervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something\nof that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.\_ Now, then, I\nmust see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,\nshe cannot be looked after.\_ Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the\nladies the example.\_ Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in\nevincing superiority to idle terrors.\_ Amy and Louisa, return to your\nnests like a pair of doves, as you are.\_\_ Mesdames” (to the dowagers),\n“you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill\ngallery any longer.”\n\nAnd so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get\nthem all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.\_ I did not\nwait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I\nhad left it.\n\nNot, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself\ncarefully.\_ The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that\nhad been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had\nproceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not\na servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and\nthat the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention\nframed to pacify his guests.\_ I dressed, then, to be ready for\nemergencies.\_ When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out\nover the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not\nwhat.\_ It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,\nstruggle, and call.\n\nNo: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and\nin about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.\_ It\nseemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire.\_ Meantime the moon\ndeclined: she was about to set.\_ Not liking to sit in the cold and\ndarkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.\_ I\nleft the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I\nstooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.\n\n“Am I wanted?” I asked.\n\n“Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master’s.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And dressed?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Come out, then, quietly.”\n\nI obeyed.\_ Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.\n\n“I want you,” he said: “come this way: take your time, and make no\nnoise.”\n\nMy slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a\ncat.\_ He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the\ndark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood\nat his side.\n\n“Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Have you any salts—volatile salts?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Go back and fetch both.”\n\nI returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,\nand once more retraced my steps.\_ He still waited; he held a key in his\nhand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;\nhe paused, and addressed me again.\n\n“You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”\n\n“I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”\n\nI felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.\n\n“Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting\nfit.”\n\nI put my fingers into his.\_ “Warm and steady,” was his remark: he turned\nthe key and opened the door.\n\nI saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax\nshowed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry\nwas now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had\nthen been concealed.\_ This door was open; a light shone out of the room\nwithin: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog\nquarrelling.\_ Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait\na minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment.\_ A shout of\nlaughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace\nPoole’s own goblin ha! ha!\_ She then was there.\_ He made some sort of\narrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he\ncame out and closed the door behind him.\n\n“Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large\nbed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of\nthe chamber.\_ An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,\ndressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant\nback; his eyes were closed.\_ Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I\nrecognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:\nI saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in\nblood.\n\n“Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin\nof water from the washstand: “Hold that,” said he.\_ I obeyed.\_ He took\nthe sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked\nfor my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.\_ Mr. Mason\nshortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.\_ Mr. Rochester opened the shirt\nof the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged\naway blood, trickling fast down.\n\n“Is there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason.\n\n“Pooh!\_ No—a mere scratch.\_ Don’t be so overcome, man: bear up!\_ I’ll\nfetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you’ll be able to be removed by\nmorning, I hope.\_ Jane,” he continued.\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an\nhour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it\nreturns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that\nstand to his lips, and your salts to his nose.\_ You will not speak to\nhim on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if\nyou speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I’ll not answer\nfor the consequences.”\n\nAgain the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,\neither of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.\_\nMr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to\nuse it as he had done.\_ He watched me a second, then saying,\n“Remember!—No conversation,” he left the room.\_ I experienced a strange\nfeeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating\nstep ceased to be heard.\n\nHere then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic\ncells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and\nhands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that\nwas appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of\nGrace Poole bursting out upon me.\n\nI must keep to my post, however.\_ I must watch this ghastly\ncountenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now\nshut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and\never glazed with the dulness of horror.\_ I must dip my hand again and\nagain in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling\ngore.\_ I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my\nemployment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round\nme, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver\nstrangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,\ndivided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the\ntwelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;\nwhile above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\n\nAccording as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or\nglanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his\nbrow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of\nJudas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and\nthreatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his\nsubordinate’s form.\n\nAmidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the\nmovements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.\_ But since\nMr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but\nthree sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal\nof the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.\n\nThen my own thoughts worried me.\_ What crime was this that lived\nincarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor\nsubdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now\nin blood, at the deadest hours of night?\_ What creature was it, that,\nmasked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice, now of\na mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?\n\nAnd this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he\nbecome involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at\nhim?\_ What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely\nseason, when he should have been asleep in bed?\_ I had heard Mr.\nRochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here!\_ And why,\nnow, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him?\_ Why did\nhe so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?\_ Why\ndid Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment?\_ His guest had been\noutraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted\nagainst; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in\noblivion!\_ Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that\nthe impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness\nof the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of\nthis.\_ It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive\ndisposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active\nenergy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when\nhe heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival?\_ Why had the mere name of this\nunresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a\nchild—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on\nan oak?\n\nOh!\_ I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:\n“Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.”\_ I could not forget\nhow the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no\nlight matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the\nvigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.\n\n“When will he come?\_ When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night\nlingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:\nand neither day nor aid arrived.\_ I had, again and again, held the water\nto Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating\nsalts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering,\nor loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his\nstrength.\_ He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he\nwas dying; and I might not even speak to him.\n\nThe candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks\nof grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.\_\nPresently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the\ncourtyard: hope revived.\_ Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more\nthe grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.\_ It\ncould not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed\nshorter.\n\nMr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.\n\n“Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last: “I give you but\nhalf-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the\npatient downstairs and all.”\n\n“But is he fit to move, sir?”\n\n“No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must\nbe kept up.\_ Come, set to work.”\n\nMr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,\nlet in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see\nhow far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten\nthe east.\_ Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already\nhandling.\n\n“Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked.\n\n“She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply.\n\n“Not a whit!—courage!\_ This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the\nworse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all.\_ Carter, assure him\nthere’s no danger.”\n\n“I can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the\nbandages; “only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have\nbled so much—but how is this?\_ The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well\nas cut.\_ This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth\nhere!”\n\n“She bit me,” he murmured.\_ “She worried me like a tigress, when\nRochester got the knife from her.”\n\n“You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at\nonce,” said Mr. Rochester.\n\n“But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason.\_ “Oh,\nit was frightful!” he added, shuddering.\_ “And I did not expect it: she\nlooked so quiet at first.”\n\n“I warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said—be on your guard when\nyou go near her.\_ Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had\nme with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and\nalone.”\n\n“I thought I could have done some good.”\n\n“You thought! you thought!\_ Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,\nhowever, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not\ntaking my advice; so I’ll say no more.\_ Carter—hurry!—hurry!\_ The sun\nwill soon rise, and I must have him off.”\n\n“Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.\_ I must look to this\nother wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.”\n\n“She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,” said Mason.\n\nI saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,\nhorror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only\nsaid—\n\n“Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat\nit.”\n\n“I wish I could forget it,” was the answer.\n\n“You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish\nTown, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not\nthink of her at all.”\n\n“Impossible to forget this night!”\n\n“It is not impossible: have some energy, man.\_ You thought you were as\ndead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking\nnow.\_ There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent\nin a trice.\_ Jane” (he turned to me for the first time since his\nre-entrance), “take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight\nforward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and\ntake out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be\nnimble.”\n\nI went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles\nnamed, and returned with them.\n\n“Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while I order his\ntoilet; but don’t leave the room: you may be wanted again.”\n\nI retired as directed.\n\n“Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired Mr.\nRochester presently.\n\n“No, sir; all was very still.”\n\n“We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for\nyour sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.\_ I have striven\nlong to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.\_ Here,\nCarter, help him on with his waist-coat.\_ Where did you leave your\nfurred cloak?\_ You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this\ndamned cold climate.\_ In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s\nroom,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there.”\n\nAgain I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and\nedged with fur.\n\n“Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you must\naway to my room again.\_ What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a\nclod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.\_ You must open\nthe middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a\nlittle glass you will find there,—quick!”\n\nI flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.\n\n“That’s well!\_ Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a\ndose myself, on my own responsibility.\_ I got this cordial at Rome, of\nan Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.\_ It is not\na thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as\nnow, for instance.\_ Jane, a little water.”\n\nHe held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle\non the washstand.\n\n“That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”\n\nI did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it\nto Mason.\n\n“Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or\nso.”\n\n“But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?”\n\n“Drink! drink! drink!”\n\nMr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.\_ He was\ndressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and\nsullied.\_ Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed\nthe liquid; he then took his arm—\n\n“Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.”\n\nThe patient rose.\n\n“Carter, take him under the other shoulder.\_ Be of good cheer, Richard;\nstep out—that’s it!”\n\n“I do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason.\n\n“I am sure you do.\_ Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;\nunbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you\nwill see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive his\nrattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,\nif any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”\n\nIt was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of\nrising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.\_ The side-passage\ndoor was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the\nyard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a\npost-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,\nstationed outside.\_ I approached him, and said the gentlemen were\ncoming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.\_ The\nstillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet\ndrawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just\ntwittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped\nlike white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the\ncarriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all\nelse was still.\n\nThe gentlemen now appeared.\_ Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the\nsurgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the\nchaise; Carter followed.\n\n“Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep him at\nyour house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to\nsee how he gets on.\_ Richard, how is it with you?”\n\n“The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.”\n\n“Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,\nDick.”\n\n“Fairfax—”\n\n“Well what is it?”\n\n“Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let\nher—” he stopped and burst into tears.\n\n“I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: he\nshut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.\n\n“Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester, as\nhe closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.\n\nThis done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in\nthe wall bordering the orchard.\_ I, supposing he had done with me,\nprepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call\n“Jane!”\_ He had opened feel portal and stood at it, waiting for me.\n\n“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that\nhouse is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”\n\n“It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”\n\n“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you\nsee it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is\nslime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,\nand the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.\_ Now here”\n(he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet,\nand pure.”\n\nHe strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and\ncherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of\nold-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,\nmingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.\_\nThey were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,\nfollowed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just\nentering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy\norchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.\n\n“Jane, will you have a flower?”\n\nHe gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to\nme.\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“Do you like this sunrise, Jane?\_ That sky with its high and light\nclouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid and\nbalmly atmosphere?”\n\n“I do, very much.”\n\n“You have passed a strange night, Jane.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone\nwith Mason?”\n\n“I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”\n\n“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have\nbeen a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a\nwolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”\n\n“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”\n\n“Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your\nthoughts.”\n\n“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”\n\n“Never fear—I will take care of myself.”\n\n“Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”\n\n“I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.\_\nTo live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and\nspue fire any day.”\n\n“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.\_ Your influence, sir, is\nevidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully\ninjure you.”\n\n“Oh, no!\_ Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,\nunintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,\nif not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”\n\n“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him\nhow to avert the danger.”\n\nHe laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it\nfrom him.\n\n“If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?\_ Annihilated\nin a moment.\_ Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to\nhim ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done.\_ But I cannot give him\norders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for\nit is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is\npossible.\_ Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.\_ You are\nmy little friend, are you not?”\n\n“I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”\n\n“Precisely: I see you do.\_ I see genuine contentment in your gait and\nmien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me—working\nfor me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, ‘all that is\nright:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no\nlight-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and\nanimated complexion.\_ My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,\nand would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it\nis wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed star.\_ Well, you too\nhave power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I\nam vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should\ntransfix me at once.”\n\n“If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,\nyou are very safe.”\n\n“God grant it may be so!\_ Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”\n\nThe arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a\nrustic seat.\_ Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but\nI stood before him.\n\n“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two.\_ You don’t hesitate\nto take a place at my side, do you?\_ Is that wrong, Jane?”\n\nI answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been\nunwise.\n\n“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the\nflowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their\nyoung ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their\nfirst spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to\nsuppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease,\nand not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in\nstaying.”\n\n“No, sir; I am content.”\n\n“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a\ngirl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood\nupwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you\nthere commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what\nmotives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and\ntaint all your existence.\_ Mind, I don’t say a crime; I am not\nspeaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make\nthe perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error.\_ The results\nof what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you\ntake measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful\nnor culpable.\_ Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the\nvery confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you\nfeel will not leave it till the time of setting.\_ Bitter and base\nassociations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here\nand there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in\nheartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights\nfeeling.\_ Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of\nvoluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no\nmatter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities\nwhich you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;\nand they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.\_ Such\nsociety revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher\nwishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend\nwhat remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.\_\nTo attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of\ncustom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience\nsanctifies nor your judgment approves?”\n\nHe paused for an answer: and what was I to say?\_ Oh, for some good\nspirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!\_ Vain\naspiration!\_ The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle\nAriel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the\ntree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.\n\nAgain Mr. Rochester propounded his query:\n\n“Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man\njustified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for\never this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own\npeace of mind and regeneration of life?”\n\n“Sir,” I answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation should\nnever depend on a fellow-creature.\_ Men and women die; philosophers\nfalter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has\nsuffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to\namend and solace to heal.”\n\n“But the instrument—the instrument!\_ God, who does the work, ordains the\ninstrument.\_ I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,\ndissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for\nmy cure in—”\n\nHe paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.\_ I\nalmost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the\nsuspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes—so\nlong was the silence protracted.\_ At last I looked up at the tardy\nspeaker: he was looking eagerly at me.\n\n“Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face changed\ntoo, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and\nsarcastic—“you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don’t\nyou think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?”\n\nHe got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when\nhe came back he was humming a tune.\n\n“Jane, Jane,” said he, stopping before me, “you are quite pale with your\nvigils: don’t you curse me for disturbing your rest?”\n\n“Curse you?\_ No, sir.”\n\n“Shake hands in confirmation of the word.\_ What cold fingers!\_ They were\nwarmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious\nchamber.\_ Jane, when will you watch with me again?”\n\n“Whenever I can be useful, sir.”\n\n“For instance, the night before I am married!\_ I am sure I shall not be\nable to sleep.\_ Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?\_\nTo you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know\nher.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“She’s a rare one, is she not, Jane?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just\nsuch as the ladies of Carthage must have had.\_ Bless me! there’s Dent\nand Lynn in the stables!\_ Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.”\n\nAs I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying\ncheerfully—\n\n“Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before\nsunrise: I rose at four to see him off.”\n"
