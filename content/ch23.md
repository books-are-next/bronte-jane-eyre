title: "\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nPresentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are\nsigns; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not\nyet found the key.\_ I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because\nI have had strange ones of my own.\_ Sympathies, I believe, exist (for\ninstance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives\nasserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to\nwhich each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal\ncomprehension.\_ And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies\nof Nature with man.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie\nLeaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little\nchild; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either\nto one’s self or one’s kin.\_ The saying might have worn out of my\nmemory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served\nindelibly to fix it there.\_ The next day Bessie was sent for home to the\ndeathbed of her little sister.\n\nOf late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during\nthe past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not\nbrought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my\narms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with\ndaisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.\_ It\nwas a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it\nnestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the\napparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven\nsuccessive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\n\nI did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one\nimage, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the\nvision drew near.\_ It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I\nhad been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was\non the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a\nmessage that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.\_ On repairing\nthither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a\ngentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he\nheld in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.\n\n“I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,” he said, rising as I entered;\n“but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at\nGateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.”\n\n“Oh, Robert! how do you do?\_ I remember you very well: you used to give\nme a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana’s bay pony.\_ And how is Bessie?\_\nYou are married to Bessie?”\n\n“Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another\nlittle one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and\nchild are thriving.”\n\n“And are the family well at the house, Robert?”\n\n“I am sorry I can’t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very\nbadly at present—in great trouble.”\n\n“I hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress.\_ He too\nlooked down at the crape round his hat and replied—\n\n“Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.”\n\n“Mr. John?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And how does his mother bear it?”\n\n“Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been\nvery wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways,\nand his death was shocking.”\n\n“I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.”\n\n“Doing well!\_ He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate\namongst the worst men and the worst women.\_ He got into debt and into\njail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he\nreturned to his old companions and habits.\_ His head was not strong: the\nknaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.\_ He\ncame down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give\nup all to him.\_ Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by\nhis extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he\nwas dead.\_ How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”\n\nI was silent: the things were frightful.\_ Robert Leaven resumed—\n\n“Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very\nstout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of\npoverty were quite breaking her down.\_ The information about Mr. John’s\ndeath and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.\_\nShe was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather\nbetter: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making\nsigns to my wife and mumbling.\_ It was only yesterday morning, however,\nthat Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she\nmade out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to\nher.’\_ Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means\nanything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and\nadvised them to send for you.\_ The young ladies put it off at first; but\ntheir mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times,\nthat at last they consented.\_ I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can\nget ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow\nmorning.”\n\n“Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.”\n\n“I think so too, Miss.\_ Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:\nbut I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?”\n\n“Yes; and I will do it now;” and having directed him to the servants’\nhall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the attentions\nof John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.\n\nHe was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the\nstables, or the grounds.\_ I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes:\nshe believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.\_ To the\nbilliard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices\nresounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and\ntheir admirers, were all busied in the game.\_ It required some courage\nto disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could\nnot defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram’s\nside.\_ She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes\nseemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?” and when I\nsaid, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement as if tempted\nto order me away.\_ I remember her appearance at the moment—it was very\ngraceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a\ngauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair.\_ She had been all animation\nwith the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her\nhaughty lineaments.\n\n“Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.\nRochester turned to see who the “person” was.\_ He made a curious\ngrimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his\ncue and followed me from the room.\n\n“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom\ndoor, which he had shut.\n\n“If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”\n\n“What to do?—where to go?”\n\n“To see a sick lady who has sent for me.”\n\n“What sick lady?—where does she live?”\n\n“At Gateshead; in ---shire.”\n\n“-shire?\_ That is a hundred miles off!\_ Who may she be that sends for\npeople to see her that distance?”\n\n“Her name is Reed, sir—Mrs. Reed.”\n\n“Reed of Gateshead?\_ There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.”\n\n“It is his widow, sir.”\n\n“And what have you to do with her?\_ How do you know her?”\n\n“Mr. Reed was my uncle—my mother’s brother.”\n\n“The deuce he was!\_ You never told me that before: you always said you\nhad no relations.”\n\n“None that would own me, sir.\_ Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me\noff.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”\n\n“But Reed left children?—you must have cousins?\_ Sir George Lynn was\ntalking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the\nveriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of\nthe same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago\nin London.”\n\n“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his\nfamily, and is supposed to have committed suicide.\_ The news so shocked\nhis mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.”\n\n“And what good can you do her?\_ Nonsense, Jane!\_ I would never think of\nrunning a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead\nbefore you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.”\n\n“Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very\ndifferent: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.”\n\n“How long will you stay?”\n\n“As short a time as possible, sir.”\n\n“Promise me only to stay a week—”\n\n“I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.”\n\n“At all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any\npretext to take up a permanent residence with her?”\n\n“Oh, no!\_ I shall certainly return if all be well.”\n\n“And who goes with you?\_ You don’t travel a hundred miles alone.”\n\n“No, sir, she has sent her coachman.”\n\n“A person to be trusted?”\n\n“Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.”\n\nMr. Rochester meditated.\_ “When do you wish to go?”\n\n“Early to-morrow morning, sir.”\n\n“Well, you must have some money; you can’t travel without money, and I\ndaresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.\_ How much\nhave you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.\n\nI drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.\_ “Five shillings, sir.”\_ He\ntook the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as\nif its scantiness amused him.\_ Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,”\nsaid he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but\nfifteen.\_ I told him I had no change.\n\n“I don’t want change; you know that.\_ Take your wages.”\n\nI declined accepting more than was my due.\_ He scowled at first; then,\nas if recollecting something, he said—\n\n“Right, right!\_ Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay\naway three months if you had fifty pounds.\_ There are ten; is it not\nplenty?”\n\n“Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.”\n\n“Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.”\n\n“Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you\nwhile I have the opportunity.”\n\n“Matter of business?\_ I am curious to hear it.”\n\n“You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be\nmarried?”\n\n“Yes; what then?”\n\n“In that case, sir, Adèle ought to go to school: I am sure you will\nperceive the necessity of it.”\n\n“To get her out of my bride’s way, who might otherwise walk over her\nrather too emphatically?\_ There’s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt\nof it.\_ Adèle, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must\nmarch straight to—the devil?”\n\n“I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.”\n\n“In course!” he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of\nfeatures equally fantastic and ludicrous.\_ He looked at me some minutes.\n\n“And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by\nyou to seek a place, I suppose?”\n\n“No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me\nin asking favours of them—but I shall advertise.”\n\n“You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!” he growled.\_ “At your peril\nyou advertise!\_ I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten\npounds.\_ Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I’ve a use for it.”\n\n“And so have I, sir,” I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind\nme.\_ “I could not spare the money on any account.”\n\n“Little niggard!” said he, “refusing me a pecuniary request!\_ Give me\nfive pounds, Jane.”\n\n“Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.”\n\n“Just let me look at the cash.”\n\n“No, sir; you are not to be trusted.”\n\n“Jane!”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Promise me one thing.”\n\n“I’ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.”\n\n“Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.\_ I’ll\nfind you one in time.”\n\n“I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that\nI and Adèle shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters\nit.”\n\n“Very well! very well!\_ I’ll pledge my word on it.\_ You go to-morrow,\nthen?”\n\n“Yes, sir; early.”\n\n“Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?”\n\n“No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.”\n\n“Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?”\n\n“I suppose so, sir.”\n\n“And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?\_ Teach me;\nI’m not quite up to it.”\n\n“They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.”\n\n“Then say it.”\n\n“Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.”\n\n“What must I say?”\n\n“The same, if you like, sir.”\n\n“Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.\_ I should like\nsomething else: a little addition to the rite.\_ If one shook hands, for\ninstance; but no—that would not content me either.\_ So you’ll do no more\nthan say Farewell, Jane?”\n\n“It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word\nas in many.”\n\n“Very likely; but it is blank and cool—‘Farewell.’”\n\n“How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?” I asked\nmyself; “I want to commence my packing.”\_ The dinner-bell rang, and\nsuddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more\nduring the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.\n\nI reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of\nthe first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.\_ It\nwas very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little\nwhite curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were\nburnished bright, and the fire burnt clear.\_ Bessie sat on the hearth,\nnursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a\ncorner.\n\n“Bless you!—I knew you would come!” exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.\n\n“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not too\nlate.\_ How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”\n\n“Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.\_ The\ndoctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she\nwill finally recover.”\n\n“Has she mentioned me lately?”\n\n“She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,\nbut she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the\nhouse.\_ She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and\nwakes up about six or seven.\_ Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,\nand then I will go up with you?”\n\nRobert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle\nand went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my\nbonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.\_ I was\nglad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my\ntravelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a\nchild.\n\nOld times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling\nabout—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and\nbutter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert\nor Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former\ndays.\_ Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot\nand good looks.\n\nTea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit\nstill, quite in her old peremptory tones.\_ I must be served at the\nfireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with\nmy cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me\nwith some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled\nand obeyed her as in bygone days.\n\nShe wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a\nperson the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,\nwhether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.\_ I told her he was\nrather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me\nkindly, and I was content.\_ Then I went on to describe to her the gay\ncompany that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details\nBessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she\nrelished.\n\nIn such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my\nbonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.\_\nIt was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked\ndown the path I was now ascending.\_ On a dark, misty, raw morning in\nJanuary, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered\nheart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly\nharbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.\_ The same\nhostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;\nand I had yet an aching heart.\_ I still felt as a wanderer on the face\nof the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own\npowers, and less withering dread of oppression.\_ The gaping wound of my\nwrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment\nextinguished.\n\n“You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she\npreceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”\n\nIn another moment I was within that apartment.\_ There was every article\nof furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first\nintroduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still\ncovered the hearth.\_ Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could\ndistinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their\nold place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian\nNights ranged just above.\_ The inanimate objects were not changed; but\nthe living things had altered past recognition.\n\nTwo young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as\nMiss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.\_ There\nwas something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme\nplainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen\ncollar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of\na string of ebony beads and a crucifix.\_ This I felt sure was Eliza,\nthough I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that\nelongated and colourless visage.\n\nThe other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I\nremembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.\_ This was a\nfull-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and\nregular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.\_ The\nhue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from\nher sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as\nthe other’s looked puritanical.\n\nIn each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one;\nthe thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the\nblooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and\nchin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable\nhardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\n\nBoth ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by\nthe name of “Miss Eyre.”\_ Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short,\nabrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her\neyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.\_ Georgiana added to her “How\nd’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,\nuttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry\nside-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the folds\nof my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my\ncottage bonnet.\_ Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know\nthat they think you a “quiz” without actually saying the words.\_ A\ncertain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of\ntone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing\nthem by any positive rudeness in word or deed.\n\nA sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power\nover me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised\nto find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the\nsemi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor\nGeorgiana ruffle me.\_ The fact was, I had other things to think about;\nwithin the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more\npotent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute\nand exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict\nor bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.\n\n“How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who\nthought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected\nliberty.\n\n“Mrs. Reed?\_ Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you\ncan see her to-night.”\n\n“If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I\nshould be much obliged to you.”\n\nGeorgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.\_\n“I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not\ndefer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”\n\n“Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza.\_ I soon\nrose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would\njust step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and ask her\nto ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not\nto-night.\_ I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my\nerrand, I proceeded to take further measures.\_ It had heretofore been my\nhabit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I\nshould, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next\nmorning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a\nfoolish plan.\_ I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt,\nand I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her\ndaughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself\nindependent of it.\_ So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me\na room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two,\nhad my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I\nmet Bessie on the landing.\n\n“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and let\nus see if she will know you.”\n\nI did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so\noften been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.\_ I\nhastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood\non the table, for it was now getting dark.\_ There was the great\nfour-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the\narmchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been\nsentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.\_ I\nlooked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim\noutline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to\nleap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.\_ I\napproached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled\npillows.\n\nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar\nimage.\_ It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance\nand hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.\_ I had left this woman\nin bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion\nthan a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to\nforget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in\namity.\n\nThe well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that\npeculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,\nimperious, despotic eyebrow.\_ How often had it lowered on me menace and\nhate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows\nrevived as I traced its harsh line now!\_ And yet I stooped down and\nkissed her: she looked at me.\n\n“Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.\n\n“Yes, Aunt Reed.\_ How are you, dear aunt?”\n\nI had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no\nsin to forget and break that vow now.\_ My fingers had fastened on her\nhand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should\nat that moment have experienced true pleasure.\_ But unimpressionable\nnatures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily\neradicated.\_ Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather\nfrom me, she remarked that the night was warm.\_ Again she regarded me so\nicily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling towards me—was\nunchanged and unchangeable.\_ I knew by her stony eye—opaque to\ntenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider me\nbad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous\npleasure: only a sense of mortification.\n\nI felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to\nsubdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.\_\nMy tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their\nsource.\_ I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over\nthe pillow.\n\n“You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to\nstay till I see how you get on.”\n\n“Oh, of course!\_ You have seen my daughters?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things\nover with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a\ndifficulty in recalling them.\_ But there was something I wished to\nsay—let me see—”\n\nThe wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place\nin her once vigorous frame.\_ Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes\nround her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down:\nshe was at once irritated.\n\n“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast.\_ Are\nyou Jane Eyre?”\n\n“I am Jane Eyre.”\n\n“I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.\_\nSuch a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she caused\nme, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her\nsudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one’s\nmovements!\_ I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like\na fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her\naway from the house.\_ What did they do with her at Lowood?\_ The fever\nbroke out there, and many of the pupils died.\_ She, however, did not\ndie: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”\n\n“A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”\n\n“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only\nsister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s\ndisowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her\ndeath, he wept like a simpleton.\_ He would send for the baby; though I\nentreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its\nmaintenance.\_ I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly,\nwhining, pining thing!\_ It would wail in its cradle all night long—not\nscreaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.\_\nReed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been\nhis own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age.\_ He\nwould try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the\ndarlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed\ntheir dislike.\_ In his last illness, he had it brought continually to\nhis bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep\nthe creature.\_ I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out\nof a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.\_ John does not at all\nresemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my\nbrothers—he is quite a Gibson.\_ Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me\nwith letters for money?\_ I have no more money to give him: we are\ngetting poor.\_ I must send away half the servants and shut up part of\nthe house; or let it off.\_ I can never submit to do that—yet how are we\nto get on?\_ Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of\nmortgages.\_ John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy!\_ He is\nbeset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I\nfeel ashamed for him when I see him.”\n\nShe was getting much excited.\_ “I think I had better leave her now,”\nsaid I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\n\n“Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night—in\nthe morning she is calmer.”\n\nI rose.\_ “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished\nto say.\_ He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death,\nor mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great\nwound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.\_ I am come to\na strange pass: I have heavy troubles.\_ What is to be done?\_ How is the\nmoney to be had?”\n\nBessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she\nsucceeded with difficulty.\_ Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed,\nand sank into a dozing state.\_ I then left her.\n\nMore than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with\nher.\_ She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor\nforbade everything which could painfully excite her.\_ Meantime, I got on\nas well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.\_ They were very cold,\nindeed, at first.\_ Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or\nwriting, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.\_\nGeorgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and\ntake no notice of me.\_ But I was determined not to seem at a loss for\noccupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and\nthey served me for both.\n\nProvided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to\ntake a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in\nsketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened\nmomentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of\nimagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a\nship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s\nhead, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in\na hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.\n\nOne morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to\nbe, I did not care or know.\_ I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad\npoint, and worked away.\_ Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and\nprominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour\ngave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with\nfeatures.\_ Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that\nbrow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight\nridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means\nnarrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of\ncourse, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on\nthe temples, and waved above the forehead.\_ Now for the eyes: I had left\nthem to the last, because they required the most careful working.\_ I\ndrew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and\nsombre; the irids lustrous and large.\_ “Good! but not quite the thing,”\nI thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;”\nand I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more\nbrilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success.\_ There, I had a\nfriend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young\nladies turned their backs on me?\_ I looked at it; I smiled at the\nspeaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\n\n“Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had\napproached me unnoticed.\_ I responded that it was merely a fancy head,\nand hurried it beneath the other sheets.\_ Of course, I lied: it was, in\nfact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.\_ But what was\nthat to her, or to any one but myself?\_ Georgiana also advanced to\nlook.\_ The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly\nman.” They both seemed surprised at my skill.\_ I offered to sketch their\nportraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.\_ Then Georgiana\nproduced her album.\_ I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing:\nthis put her at once into good humour.\_ She proposed a walk in the\ngrounds.\_ Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a\nconfidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the\nbrilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the\nadmiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I\neven got hints of the titled conquest she had made.\_ In the course of\nthe afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft\nconversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in\nshort, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised\nby her for my benefit.\_ The communications were renewed from day to day:\nthey always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and woes.\_ It was\nstrange she never once adverted either to her mother’s illness, or her\nbrother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects.\_\nHer mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and\naspirations after dissipations to come.\_ She passed about five minutes\neach day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.\n\nEliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.\_ I never\nsaw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say\nwhat she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.\_ She\nhad an alarm to call her up early.\_ I know not how she occupied herself\nbefore breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular\nportions, and each hour had its allotted task.\_ Three times a day she\nstudied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer\nBook.\_ I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume,\nand she said, “the Rubric.”\_ Three hours she gave to stitching, with\ngold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough\nfor a carpet.\_ In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article,\nshe informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately\nerected near Gateshead.\_ Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to\nworking by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of\nher accounts.\_ She seemed to want no company; no conversation.\_ I\nbelieve she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and\nnothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which\nforced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\n\nShe told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than\nusual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had\nbeen a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,\nsettled her mind, and formed her resolution.\_ Her own fortune she had\ntaken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly\nimprobable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or\nlinger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a\nretirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from\ndisturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous\nworld.\_ I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\n\n“Of course not.\_ Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had\nhad.\_ She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.\_\nGeorgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”\n\nGeorgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time\nin lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and\nwishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an\ninvitation up to town.\_ “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she\ncould only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.”\_ I\ndid not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she\nreferred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of\nfuneral rites.\_ Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s\nindolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had\nbeen before her.\_ One day, however, as she put away her account-book and\nunfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—\n\n“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never\nallowed to cumber the earth.\_ You had no right to be born, for you make\nno use of life.\_ Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a\nreasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some\nother person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or\nhimself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that\nyou are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.\_ Then, too, existence for you\nmust be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is\na dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be\nflattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish, you\ndie away.\_ Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you\nindependent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?\_ Take one day;\nshare it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no\nstray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include\nall; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid\nregularity.\_ The day will close almost before you are aware it has\nbegun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one\nvacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation,\nsympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being\nought to do.\_ Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you;\nthen you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.\_ Neglect\nit—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer the\nresults of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.\_ I tell\nyou this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I\nam now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.\_ After my mother’s\ndeath, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the\nvault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had\nnever known each other.\_ You need not think that because we chanced to\nbe born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by\neven the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human race,\nourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the\nearth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the\nnew.”\n\nShe closed her lips.\n\n“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,”\nanswered Georgiana.\_ “Everybody knows you are the most selfish,\nheartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred\ntowards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played\nme about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you,\nto have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show\nyour face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my\nprospects for ever.”\_ Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her\nnose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously\nindustrious.\n\nTrue, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were\ntwo natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably\nsavourless for the want of it.\_ Feeling without judgment is a washy\ndraught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and\nhusky a morsel for human deglutition.\n\nIt was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the\nsofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint’s-day\nservice at the new church—for in matters of religion she was a rigid\nformalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she\nconsidered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church\nthrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.\n\nI bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who\nlay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent\nattention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of\nthe room whenever she could.\_ Bessie was faithful; but she had her own\nfamily to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.\_ I found\nthe sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the\npatient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the\npillows: the fire was dying in the grate.\_ I renewed the fuel,\nre-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze\non me, and then I moved away to the window.\n\nThe rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:\n“One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of earthly\nelements.\_ Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its material\ntenement—flit when at length released?”\n\nIn pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her\ndying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied\nsouls.\_ I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered\ntones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and\nsublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her\nlonging to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice\nmurmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”\n\nI knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?\_ I went up\nto her.\n\n“It is I, Aunt Reed.”\n\n“Who—I?” was her answer.\_ “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and\na sort of alarm, but still not wildly.\_ “You are quite a stranger to\nme—where is Bessie?”\n\n“She is at the lodge, aunt.”\n\n“Aunt,” she repeated.\_ “Who calls me aunt?\_ You are not one of the\nGibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are\nquiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”\n\nI said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my\nidentity.\n\n“Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.\_\nI wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:\nbesides, in eight years she must be so changed.”\_ I now gently assured\nher that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing\nthat I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I\nexplained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.\n\n“I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long.\_ “I was trying to turn\nmyself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.\_ It is as\nwell I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in\nhealth, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.\_ Is the\nnurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”\n\nI assured her we were alone.\n\n“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.\_ One was in\nbreaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own\nchild; the other—” she stopped.\_ “After all, it is of no great\nimportance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get\nbetter; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”\n\nShe made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;\nshe seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps,\nof the last pang.\n\n“Well, I must get it over.\_ Eternity is before me: I had better tell\nher.—Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see\nthere.”\n\nI obeyed her directions.\_ “Read the letter,” she said.\n\nIt was short, and thus conceived:—\n\n“Madam,—Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece,\nJane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?\_ It is my intention to write\nshortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.\_ Providence has blessed\nmy endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and\nchildless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my\ndeath whatever I may have to leave.—I am, Madam, &c., &c.,\nJohn Eyre, Madeira\n\n\nIt was dated three years back.\n\n“Why did I never hear of this?” I asked.\n\n“Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand\nin lifting you to prosperity.\_ I could not forget your conduct to me,\nJane—the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you\ndeclared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the\nunchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought\nof me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable\ncruelty.\_ I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up\nand poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that\nI had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me\nin a man’s voice.—Bring me some water!\_ Oh, make haste!”\n\n“Dear Mrs. Reed,” said I, as I offered her the draught she required,\n“think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.\_ Forgive me\nfor my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have\npassed since that day.”\n\nShe heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and\ndrawn breath, she went on thus—\n\n“I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be\nadopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was\nwhat I could not endure.\_ I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his\ndisappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at\nLowood.\_ Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion—expose\nmy falsehood as soon as you like.\_ You were born, I think, to be my\ntorment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but\nfor you, I should never have been tempted to commit.”\n\n“If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to\nregard me with kindness and forgiveness”\n\n“You have a very bad disposition,” said she, “and one to this day I feel\nit impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and\nquiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and\nviolence, I can never comprehend.”\n\n“My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not\nvindictive.\_ Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to\nlove you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled\nto you now: kiss me, aunt.”\n\nI approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.\_ She said I\noppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.\_ As I\nlaid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she\ndrank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble\nfingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.\n\n“Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,” I said at last, “you have my\nfull and free forgiveness: ask now for God’s, and be at peace.”\n\nPoor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to\nchange her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me—dying,\nshe must hate me still.\n\nThe nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.\_ I yet lingered half-an-hour\nlonger, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.\_ She was\nfast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve\no’clock that night she died.\_ I was not present to close her eyes, nor\nwere either of her daughters.\_ They came to tell us the next morning\nthat all was over.\_ She was by that time laid out.\_ Eliza and I went to\nlook at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she\ndared not go.\_ There was stretched Sarah Reed’s once robust and active\nframe, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid;\nher brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.\_\nA strange and solemn object was that corpse to me.\_ I gazed on it with\ngloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or\nhopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her\nwoes—not my loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of\ndeath in such a form.\n\nEliza surveyed her parent calmly.\_ After a silence of some minutes she\nobserved—\n\n“With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life\nwas shortened by trouble.”\_ And then a spasm constricted her mouth for\nan instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did\nI.\_ Neither of us had dropt a tear.\n"
