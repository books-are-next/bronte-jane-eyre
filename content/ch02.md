title: "\nPREFACE\n\n\nA preface to the first edition of “Jane Eyre” being unnecessary, I gave\nnone: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and\nmiscellaneous remark.\n\nMy thanks are due in three quarters.\n\nTo the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale\nwith few pretensions.\n\nTo the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an\nobscure aspirant.\n\nTo my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical\nsense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended\nAuthor.\n\nThe Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I\nmust thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are\ncertain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted\nand high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to\nthem, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say\ncordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.\n\nHaving thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved\nme, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,\ntherefore, to be overlooked.\_ I mean the timorous or carping few who\ndoubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever\nis unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against\nbigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on\nearth.\_ I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I\nwould remind them of certain simple truths.\n\nConventionality is not morality.\_ Self-righteousness is not religion.\_\nTo attack the first is not to assail the last.\_ To pluck the mask from\nthe face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of\nThorns.\n\nThese things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct\nas is vice from virtue.\_ Men too often confound them: they should not be\nconfounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human\ndoctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be\nsubstituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.\_ There is—I repeat\nit—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly\nand clearly the line of separation between them.\n\nThe world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been\naccustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show\npass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean\nshrines.\_ It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the\ngilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and\nreveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.\n\nAhab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning\nhim, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;\nyet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears\nto flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.\n\nThere is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle\ndelicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of\nsociety, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah\nand Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like\nand as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring.\_ Is the satirist of\n“Vanity Fair” admired in high places?\_ I cannot tell; but I think if\nsome of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and\nover whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take\nhis warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a fatal\nRimoth-Gilead.\n\nWhy have I alluded to this man?\_ I have alluded to him, Reader, because\nI think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his\ncontemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first\nsocial regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps\nwho would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I\nthink no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that\nsuits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.\_ They say he\nis like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.\_ He\nresembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on\ncarrion, but Thackeray never does.\_ His wit is bright, his humour\nattractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that\nthe mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the\nsummer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.\_ Finally,\nI have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the\ntribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of\n“Jane Eyre.”\n\nCURRER BELL.\n\nDecember 21st, 1847.\n"
