title: "\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nThe month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being\nnumbered.\_ There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal\nday; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.\_ I, at\nleast, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked,\ncorded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow,\nat this time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I\n(D.V.),—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I\nknew not.\_ The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay,\nfour little squares, in the drawer.\_ Mr. Rochester had himself written\nthe direction, “Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London,” on each: I could not\npersuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.\_ Mrs.\nRochester!\_ She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow,\nsome time after eight o’clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she\nhad come into the world alive before I assigned to her all that\nproperty.\_ It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my\ndressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black\nstuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit\nof wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent\nfrom the usurped portmanteau.\_ I shut the closet to conceal the strange,\nwraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine\no’clock—gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of\nmy apartment.\_ “I will leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said.\_ “I\nam feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel\nit.”\n\nIt was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only\nthe anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to commence\nto-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in\nproducing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this\nlate hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my\nmind more than they.\n\nI had at heart a strange and anxious thought.\_ Something had happened\nwhich I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but\nmyself: it had taken place the preceding night.\_ Mr. Rochester that\nnight was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called\nhim to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles\noff—business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to\nhis meditated departure from England.\_ I waited now his return; eager to\ndisburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that\nperplexed me.\_ Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my\nsecret to him, you shall share the confidence.\n\nI sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day\nhad blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a\nspeck of rain.\_ Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to\naugment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one\nway, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once\nin an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads\nnorthward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on\nmass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.\n\nIt was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,\ndelivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering\nthrough space.\_ Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the\nchestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the\ncentre, gasped ghastly.\_ The cloven halves were not broken from each\nother, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;\nthough community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more:\ntheir great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s tempests\nwould be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might\nbe said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.\n\n“You did right to hold fast to each other,” I said: as if the\nmonster-splinters were living things, and could hear me.\_ “I think,\nscathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little\nsense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful,\nhonest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see birds\nmaking nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and\nlove is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a\ncomrade to sympathise with him in his decay.”\_ As I looked up at them,\nthe moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their\nfissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw\non me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly\nin the deep drift of cloud.\_ The wind fell, for a second, round\nThornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy\nwail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.\n\nHere and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples\nwith which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I\nemployed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them\ninto the house and put them away in the store-room.\_ Then I repaired to\nthe library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I\nknew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful\nhearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and\nburnt well.\_ I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the\ntable near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in\nready for lighting.\_ More restless than ever, when I had completed these\narrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a\nlittle time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall\nsimultaneously struck ten.\n\n“How late it grows!” I said.\_ “I will run down to the gates: it is\nmoonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.\_ He may be\ncoming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.”\n\nThe wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but\nthe road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all\nstill and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at\nintervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried\nby one moving speck.\n\nA puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment and\nimpatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.\_ I lingered; the moon shut\nherself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense\ncloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\n\n“I wish he would come!\_ I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized with\nhypochondriac foreboding.\_ I had expected his arrival before tea; now it\nwas dark: what could keep him?\_ Had an accident happened?\_ The event of\nlast night again recurred to me.\_ I interpreted it as a warning of\ndisaster.\_ I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had\nenjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its\nmeridian, and must now decline.\n\n“Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the\nfireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs\nthan strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.”\n\nI set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a\nmile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog\nran by his side.\_ Away with evil presentiment!\_ It was he: here he was,\nmounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.\_ He saw me; for the moon had\nopened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took\nhis hat off, and waved it round his head.\_ I now ran to meet him.\n\n“There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the\nsaddle: “You can’t do without me, that is evident.\_ Step on my boot-toe;\ngive me both hands: mount!”\n\nI obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.\_ A hearty kissing I\ngot for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well\nas I could.\_ He checked himself in his exultation to demand, “But is\nthere anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an\nhour?\_ Is there anything wrong?”\n\n“No, but I thought you would never come.\_ I could not bear to wait in\nthe house for you, especially with this rain and wind.”\n\n“Rain and wind, indeed!\_ Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my\ncloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and\nhand are burning hot.\_ I ask again, is there anything the matter?”\n\n“Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.”\n\n“Then you have been both?”\n\n“Rather: but I’ll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay\nyou will only laugh at me for my pains.”\n\n“I’ll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare\nnot: my prize is not certain.\_ This is you, who have been as slippery as\nan eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?\_ I could not lay\na finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up\na stray lamb in my arms.\_ You wandered out of the fold to seek your\nshepherd, did you, Jane?”\n\n“I wanted you: but don’t boast.\_ Here we are at Thornfield: now let me\nget down.”\n\nHe landed me on the pavement.\_ As John took his horse, and he followed\nme into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and\nthen return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the\nstaircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;\nin five minutes I rejoined him.\_ I found him at supper.\n\n“Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal\nbut one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.”\n\nI sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.\_ “Is it because you\nhave the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?\_ Is it the thoughts of\ngoing to London that takes away your appetite?”\n\n“I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what\nthoughts I have in my head.\_ Everything in life seems unreal.”\n\n“Except me: I am substantial enough—touch me.”\n\n“You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.”\n\nHe held out his hand, laughing.\_ “Is that a dream?” said he, placing it\nclose to my eyes.\_ He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as\nwell as a long, strong arm.\n\n“Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,” said I, as I put it down from\nbefore my face.\_ “Sir, have you finished supper?”\n\n“Yes, Jane.”\n\nI rang the bell and ordered away the tray.\_ When we were again alone, I\nstirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee.\n\n“It is near midnight,” I said.\n\n“Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before\nmy wedding.”\n\n“I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have\nno wish to go to bed.”\n\n“Are all your arrangements complete?”\n\n“All, sir.”\n\n“And on my part likewise,” he returned, “I have settled everything; and\nwe shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our\nreturn from church.”\n\n“Very well, sir.”\n\n“With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—‘very well,’\nJane!\_ What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how\nstrangely your eyes glitter!\_ Are you well?”\n\n“I believe I am.”\n\n“Believe!\_ What is the matter?\_ Tell me what you feel.”\n\n“I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.\_ I wish this\npresent hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come\ncharged?”\n\n“This is hypochondria, Jane.\_ You have been over-excited, or\nover-fatigued.”\n\n“Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?”\n\n“Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.”\n\nI looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent\nand flushed.\n\n“Give me your confidence, Jane,” he said: “relieve your mind of any\nweight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.\_ What do you fear?—that\nI shall not prove a good husband?”\n\n“It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.”\n\n“Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the\nnew life into which you are passing?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex\nand pain me.\_ I want an explanation.”\n\n“Then, sir, listen.\_ You were from home last night?”\n\n“I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had\nhappened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in\nshort, it has disturbed you.\_ Let me hear it.\_ Mrs. Fairfax has said\nsomething, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your\nsensitive self-respect has been wounded?”\n\n“No, sir.”\_ It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded\nits silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I\nproceeded.\n\n“All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless\nbustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting\nfears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to\nhave the hope of living with you, because I love you.\_ No, sir, don’t\ncaress me now—let me talk undisturbed.\_ Yesterday I trusted well in\nProvidence, and believed that events were working together for your good\nand mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the air\nand sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your\njourney.\_ I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of\nyou; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your\nactual presence.\_ I thought of the life that lay before me—your\nlife, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much\nmore so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the\nshallows of its own strait channel.\_ I wondered why moralists call this\nworld a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.\_ Just at\nsunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called\nme upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought;\nand under it in the box I found your present—the veil which, in your\nprincely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose,\nsince I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as\ncostly.\_ I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you\nabout your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian\nbride in the attributes of a peeress.\_ I thought how I would carry down\nto you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a\ncovering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a\nwoman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor\nconnections.\_ I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous\nrepublican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your\npart to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying\neither a purse or a coronet.”\n\n“How well you read me, you witch!” interposed Mr. Rochester: “but what\ndid you find in the veil besides its embroidery?\_ Did you find poison,\nor a dagger, that you look so mournful now?”\n\n“No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found\nnothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride; and that did not scare me,\nbecause I am used to the sight of the demon.\_ But, sir, as it grew dark,\nthe wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and\nhigh—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie.\_ I wished you\nwere at home.\_ I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair\nand fireless hearth chilled me.\_ For some time after I went to bed, I\ncould not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.\_ The gale\nstill rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether\nin the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,\ndoubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some\ndog howling at a distance.\_ I was glad when it ceased.\_ On sleeping, I\ncontinued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.\_ I continued\nalso the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful\nconsciousness of some barrier dividing us.\_ During all my first sleep, I\nwas following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed\nme; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a\nvery small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in\nmy cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.\_ I thought, sir, that you\nwere on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to\novertake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat\nyou to stop—but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away\ninarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every\nmoment.”\n\n“And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to\nyou?\_ Little nervous subject!\_ Forget visionary woe, and think only of\nreal happiness!\_ You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget that;\nand you cannot deny it.\_ Those words did not die inarticulate on your\nlips.\_ I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but\nsweet as music—‘I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of\nliving with you, Edward, because I love you.’\_ Do you love me,\nJane?—repeat it.”\n\n“I do, sir—I do, with my whole heart.”\n\n“Well,” he said, after some minutes’ silence, “it is strange; but that\nsentence has penetrated my breast painfully.\_ Why?\_ I think because you\nsaid it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward\ngaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is\ntoo much as if some spirit were near me.\_ Look wicked, Jane: as you know\nwell how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me\nyou hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be\nincensed than saddened.”\n\n“I will tease you and vex you to your heart’s content, when I have\nfinished my tale: but hear me to the end.”\n\n“I thought, Jane, you had told me all.\_ I thought I had found the source\nof your melancholy in a dream.”\n\nI shook my head.\_ “What! is there more?\_ But I will not believe it to be\nanything important.\_ I warn you of incredulity beforehand.\_ Go on.”\n\nThe disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his\nmanner, surprised me: but I proceeded.\n\n“I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin,\nthe retreat of bats and owls.\_ I thought that of all the stately front\nnothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very\nfragile-looking.\_ I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the\ngrass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and\nthere over a fallen fragment of cornice.\_ Wrapped up in a shawl, I still\ncarried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,\nhowever tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress,\nI must retain it.\_ I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the\nroad; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and\nfor a distant country.\_ I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous\nhaste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled\nfrom under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung\nround my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the\nsummit.\_ I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every\nmoment.\_ The blast blew so strong I could not stand.\_ I sat down on the\nnarrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle\nof the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I\nwas shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and\nwoke.”\n\n“Now, Jane, that is all.”\n\n“All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.\_ On waking, a gleam\ndazzled my eyes; I thought—Oh, it is daylight!\_ But I was mistaken; it\nwas only candlelight.\_ Sophie, I supposed, had come in.\_ There was a\nlight in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before\ngoing to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard\na rustling there.\_ I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’\_ No one\nanswered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it\naloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.\_\n‘Sophie!\_ Sophie!’\_ I again cried: and still it was silent.\_ I had risen\nup in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over\nme; and then my blood crept cold through my veins.\_ Mr. Rochester, this\nwas not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not—no,\nI was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange woman, Grace\nPoole.”\n\n“It must have been one of them,” interrupted my master.\n\n“No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.\_ The shape standing\nbefore me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield\nHall before; the height, the contour were new to me.”\n\n“Describe it, Jane.”\n\n“It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair\nhanging long down her back.\_ I know not what dress she had on: it was\nwhite and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.”\n\n“Did you see her face?”\n\n“Not at first.\_ But presently she took my veil from its place; she held\nit up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and\nturned to the mirror.\_ At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage\nand features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.”\n\n“And how were they?”\n\n“Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!\_ It was\na discoloured face—it was a savage face.\_ I wish I could forget the roll\nof the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”\n\n“Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.”\n\n“This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow\nfurrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.\_\nShall I tell you of what it reminded me?”\n\n“You may.”\n\n“Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre.”\n\n“Ah!—what did it do?”\n\n“Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and\nflinging both on the floor, trampled on them.”\n\n\n\n“Afterwards?”\n\n“It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn\napproaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.\_ Just at\nmy bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—she thrust\nup her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.\_ I\nwas aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness:\nfor the second time in my life—only the second time—I became insensible\nfrom terror.”\n\n“Who was with you when you revived?”\n\n“No one, sir, but the broad day.\_ I rose, bathed my head and face in\nwater, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,\nand determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.\_ Now,\nsir, tell me who and what that woman was?”\n\n“The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.\_ I must be\ncareful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough\nhandling.”\n\n“Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the\ntransaction actually took place.”\n\n“And your previous dreams, were they real too?\_ Is Thornfield Hall a\nruin?\_ Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?\_ Am I leaving you\nwithout a tear—without a kiss—without a word?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Am I about to do it?\_ Why, the day is already commenced which is to\nbind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no\nrecurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.”\n\n“Mental terrors, sir!\_ I wish I could believe them to be only such: I\nwish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the\nmystery of that awful visitant.”\n\n“And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.”\n\n“But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I\nlooked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful\naspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet—I\nsaw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,—the veil, torn from top\nto bottom in two halves!”\n\nI felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round\nme.\_ “Thank God!” he exclaimed, “that if anything malignant did come\nnear you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.\_ Oh, to think\nwhat might have happened!”\n\nHe drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could\nscarcely pant.\_ After some minutes’ silence, he continued, cheerily—\n\n“Now, Janet, I’ll explain to you all about it.\_ It was half dream, half\nreality.\_ A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman\nwas—must have been—Grace Poole.\_ You call her a strange being yourself:\nfrom all you know, you have reason so to call her—what did she do to me?\nwhat to Mason?\_ In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her\nentrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were,\nyou ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long\ndishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were\nfigments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of\nthe veil was real: and it is like her.\_ I see you would ask why I keep\nsuch a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I\nwill tell you; but not now.\_ Are you satisfied, Jane?\_ Do you accept my\nsolution of the mystery?”\n\nI reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:\nsatisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear\nso—relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented\nsmile.\_ And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.\n\n“Does not Sophie sleep with Adèle in the nursery?” he asked, as I lit my\ncandle.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“And there is room enough in Adèle’s little bed for you.\_ You must share\nit with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have\nrelated should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep\nalone: promise me to go to the nursery.”\n\n“I shall be very glad to do so, sir.”\n\n“And fasten the door securely on the inside.\_ Wake Sophie when you go\nupstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time\nto-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before\neight.\_ And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.\_\nDon’t you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is\nno more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here” (he lifted\nup the curtain)—“it is a lovely night!”\n\nIt was.\_ Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping\nbefore the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward\nin long, silvered columns.\_ The moon shone peacefully.\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, “how is my\nJanet now?”\n\n“The night is serene, sir; and so am I.”\n\n“And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy\nlove and blissful union.”\n\nThis prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of\nsorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.\_\nWith little Adèle in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so\ntranquil, so passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day: all\nmy life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I\nrose too.\_ I remember Adèle clung to me as I left her: I remember I\nkissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over\nher with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would\nbreak her still sound repose.\_ She seemed the emblem of my past life;\nand here I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type\nof my unknown future day.\n"
