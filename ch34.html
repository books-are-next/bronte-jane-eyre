CHAPTER XXXII
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
as I could.&nbsp; It was truly hard work at first.&nbsp; Some time elapsed before,
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.&nbsp;
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
was mistaken.&nbsp; There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
rapidly developed itself.&nbsp; Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.&nbsp; Many showed themselves
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.&nbsp; These
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
manners.&nbsp; The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.&nbsp; I had
amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown,
almost.&nbsp; These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
needlework.&nbsp; I found estimable characters amongst them—characters
desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.&nbsp; Their parents then
(the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.&nbsp; There was an
enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Whenever I went out,
I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
smiles.&nbsp; To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;” serene
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.&nbsp; At this period of my life,
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
existence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I used to rush
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of
the ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
force and fire.&nbsp; Then I awoke.&nbsp; Then I recalled where I was, and how
situated.&nbsp; Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and
quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of
despair, and heard the burst of passion.&nbsp; By nine o’clock the next
morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared
for the steady duties of the day.
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.&nbsp; Her call at the
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.&nbsp; She would
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery
servant.&nbsp; Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple
habit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the
long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can
scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic
building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.&nbsp;
She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his
daily catechising lesson.&nbsp; Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress
pierce the young pastor’s heart.&nbsp; A sort of instinct seemed to warn him
of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was looking
quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow,
and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed
indescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a
repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could
indicate.
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
conceal it from her.&nbsp; In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in
his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.&nbsp; He seemed to say,
with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I
love you, and I know you prefer me.&nbsp; It is not despair of success that
keeps me dumb.&nbsp; If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.&nbsp;
But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged
round it.&nbsp; It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
and so martyr-like.&nbsp; St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not
give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love,
one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.&nbsp; Besides, he could not bind all
that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the
priest—in the limits of a single passion.&nbsp; He could not—he would
not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the
peace of Vale Hall.&nbsp; I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,
despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.&nbsp; I
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
selfish.&nbsp; She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
spoilt.&nbsp; She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she
was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like
me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.&nbsp; A
very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the
sisters of St. John.&nbsp; Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil
Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a
closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive
adult acquaintance.
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.&nbsp; She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
only, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.”&nbsp; I was, however,
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.&nbsp; I was a lusus naturæ,
she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous
history, if known, would make a delightful romance.
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and
the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French
books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then
my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a
pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views
from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.&nbsp;
She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with
delight.
“Had I done these pictures?&nbsp; Did I know French and German?&nbsp; What a
love—what a miracle I was!&nbsp; I drew better than her master in the first
school in S-.&nbsp; Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”
“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.&nbsp; She had then on a
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
wild grace of natural curls.&nbsp; I took a sheet of fine card-board, and
drew a careful outline.&nbsp; I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it;
and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit
another day.
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
flower near a hoary turret.&nbsp; He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
personage; but he was very kind to me.&nbsp; The sketch of Rosamond’s
portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of
it.&nbsp; He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at
Vale Hall.
I went.&nbsp; I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.&nbsp; Rosamond was full of glee and
pleasure all the time I stayed.&nbsp; Her father was affable; and when he
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong
terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he
only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,
and would soon quit it for one more suitable.
“Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in a
high family, papa.”
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in
the land.&nbsp; Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with
great respect.&nbsp; He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;
that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once
belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of that
house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best.&nbsp; He accounted
it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the
design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable
life away.&nbsp; It appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle
in the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John.&nbsp; Mr. Oliver evidently
regarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and sacred
profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.&nbsp; My little servant, after
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
penny for her aid.&nbsp; All about me was spotless and bright—scoured floor,
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.&nbsp; I had also made myself neat,
and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature.&nbsp; The head was
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery
to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft
curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the
lash under the azured eyelid.&nbsp; I was absorbed in the execution of these
nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St.
John Rivers.
“I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said.&nbsp; “Not, I
hope, in thought?&nbsp; No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
lonely.&nbsp; You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
wonderfully so far.&nbsp; I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and
he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those
days—the golden age of modern literature.&nbsp; Alas! the readers of our era
are less favoured.&nbsp; But courage!&nbsp; I will not pause either to accuse or
repine.&nbsp; I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon
gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their
existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.&nbsp;
Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph,
and feeble ones weep over their destruction.&nbsp; Poetry destroyed?&nbsp; Genius
banished?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the
thought.&nbsp; No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without
their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell
of your own meanness.
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for
“Marmion” it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.&nbsp; His tall
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.&nbsp; I looked up at
him: he shunned my eye.&nbsp; I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had
then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to
do him some good, if I could.
“With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself
too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses,
imparts nothing.&nbsp; I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
him talk.”
I said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.”&nbsp; But he answered, as he always
did, that he could not stay.&nbsp; “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
at least as bad for you as it is for me.&nbsp; I’ll try if I cannot discover
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that
marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of
sympathy.”
“Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.
“Like!&nbsp; Like whom?&nbsp; I did not observe it closely.”
“You did, Mr. Rivers.”
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
astonished.&nbsp; “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within.&nbsp; “I don’t
mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to
go to considerable lengths.”&nbsp; I continued, “You observed it closely and
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,” and I
rose and placed it in his hand.
“A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very
graceful and correct drawing.”
“Yes, yes; I know all that.&nbsp; But what of the resemblance?&nbsp; Who is it
like?”
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”
“Of course.&nbsp; And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.&nbsp; I
don’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
deem worthless.”
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.&nbsp; “It is like!” he murmured;
“the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.&nbsp;
It smiles!”
“Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?&nbsp;
Tell me that.&nbsp; When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India,
would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or
would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and
distress?”
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
“That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
or wise is another question.”
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my views
than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
their union.&nbsp; It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of
Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he
went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under
a tropical sun.&nbsp; With this persuasion I now answered—
“As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were
to take to yourself the original at once.”
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table
before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over
it.&nbsp; I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.&nbsp; I
saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt
by him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief.&nbsp; Reserved people often
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more
than the expansive.&nbsp; The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and
to “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the silent sea” of their
souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
“She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and
her father respects you.&nbsp; Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather
thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and
her.&nbsp; You ought to marry her.”
“Does she like me?” he asked.
“Certainly; better than she likes any one else.&nbsp; She talks of you
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
often.”
“It is very pleasant to hear this,” he said—“very: go on for another
quarter of an hour.”&nbsp; And he actually took out his watch and laid it
upon the table to measure the time.
“But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
fetter your heart?”
“Don’t imagine such hard things.&nbsp; Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
intentions, of self-denying plans.&nbsp; And now it is deluged with a
nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering them:
now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale
Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: she is talking to me with her
sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
copied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips.&nbsp; She is mine—I am
hers—this present life and passing world suffice to me.&nbsp; Hush! say
nothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the time
I marked pass in peace.”
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
silent.&nbsp; Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
“Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion.&nbsp;
I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.&nbsp; I tasted her cup.&nbsp; The pillow
was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter
taste: her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all
this.”
I gazed at him in wonder.
“It is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience at
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me
a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.&nbsp; This I know.”
“Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.
“While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her charms,
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate in nothing
I undertook.&nbsp; Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?&nbsp;
Rosamond a missionary’s wife?&nbsp; No!”
“But you need not be a missionary.&nbsp; You might relinquish that scheme.”
“Relinquish!&nbsp; What! my vocation?&nbsp; My great work?&nbsp; My foundation laid on
earth for a mansion in heaven?&nbsp; My hopes of being numbered in the band
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting
peace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of
heaven for the fear of hell?&nbsp; Must I relinquish that?&nbsp; It is dearer than
the blood in my veins.&nbsp; It is what I have to look forward to, and to
live for.”
After a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver?&nbsp; Are her
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?”
“Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than
a month, my image will be effaced from her heart.&nbsp; She will forget me;
and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
should do.”
“You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.&nbsp; You are
wasting away.”
“No.&nbsp; If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated.&nbsp; Only this morning,
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.”
“You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
schoolroom.”
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.&nbsp; He had not imagined
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.&nbsp; For me, I felt at home in
this sort of discourse.&nbsp; I could never rest in communication with
strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had
passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold
of confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone.
“You are original,” said he, “and not timid.&nbsp; There is something brave
in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to
assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.&nbsp; You think them
more profound and potent than they are.&nbsp; You give me a larger allowance
of sympathy than I have a just claim to.&nbsp; When I colour, and when I
shade before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.&nbsp; I scorn the weakness.&nbsp;
I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the
convulsion of the soul.&nbsp; That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in
the depths of a restless sea.&nbsp; Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man.”
I smiled incredulously.
“You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it is
much at your service.&nbsp; I am simply, in my original state—stripped of
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human
deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man.&nbsp; Natural affection only, of all
the sentiments, has permanent power over me.&nbsp; Reason, and not feeling,
is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do
more than others, insatiable.&nbsp; I honour endurance, perseverance,
industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great
ends and mount to lofty eminence.&nbsp; I watch your career with interest,
because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic
woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or
what you still suffer.”
“You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said.
“No.&nbsp; There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
believe; and I believe the Gospel.&nbsp; You missed your epithet.&nbsp; I am not a
pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus.&nbsp; As
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.&nbsp; I
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.&nbsp; Won in youth to religion, she
has cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ, natural
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.&nbsp; From
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense
of the Divine justice.&nbsp; Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master’s
kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.&nbsp; So much
has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best
account; pruning and training nature.&nbsp; But she could not eradicate
nature: nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put on
immortality.’”
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
palette.&nbsp; Once more he looked at the portrait.
“She is lovely,” he murmured.&nbsp; “She is well named the Rose of the
World, indeed!”
“And may I not paint one like it for you?”
“Cui bono?&nbsp; No.”
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
being sullied.&nbsp; What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.&nbsp; He took it
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for
it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.&nbsp; His lips parted, as if to
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
“What is the matter?” I asked.
“Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.&nbsp; It disappeared in
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” he vanished.
“Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps the
globe, however!”
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.&nbsp; I
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
forgot it.

      CHAPTER XXXII
      I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
      as I could.&nbsp; It was truly hard work at first.&nbsp; Some time elapsed before,
      with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.&nbsp;
      Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
      hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
      was mistaken.&nbsp; There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
      educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
      rapidly developed itself.&nbsp; Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
      and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
      rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.&nbsp; Many showed themselves
      obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
      examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
      excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.&nbsp; These
      soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
      neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
      manners.&nbsp; The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
      surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
      personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.&nbsp; I had
      amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown,
      almost.&nbsp; These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
      the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
      needlework.&nbsp; I found estimable characters amongst them—characters
      desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed
      many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.&nbsp; Their parents then
      (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.&nbsp; There was an
      enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
      consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were
      not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
      benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
      made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
      I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Whenever I went out,
      I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
      smiles.&nbsp; To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
      working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;” serene
      inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.&nbsp; At this period of my life,
      my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
      and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
      existence—after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
      an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone—I used to rush
      into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of
      the ideal, the stirring, the stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
      charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
      again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
      then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
      touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of
      passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
      force and fire.&nbsp; Then I awoke.&nbsp; Then I recalled where I was, and how
      situated.&nbsp; Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and
      quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of
      despair, and heard the burst of passion.&nbsp; By nine o’clock the next
      morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared
      for the steady duties of the day.
      Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.&nbsp; Her call at the
      school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.&nbsp; She would
      canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery
      servant.&nbsp; Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple
      habit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the
      long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can
      scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic
      building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.&nbsp;
      She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his
      daily catechising lesson.&nbsp; Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress
      pierce the young pastor’s heart.&nbsp; A sort of instinct seemed to warn him
      of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was looking
      quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow,
      and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed
      indescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a
      repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could
      indicate.
      Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
      conceal it from her.&nbsp; In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
      up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in
      his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.&nbsp; He seemed to say,
      with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I
      love you, and I know you prefer me.&nbsp; It is not despair of success that
      keeps me dumb.&nbsp; If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.&nbsp;
      But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged
      round it.&nbsp; It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”
      And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
      soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
      his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
      and so martyr-like.&nbsp; St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
      follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not
      give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love,
      one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.&nbsp; Besides, he could not bind all
      that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the
      priest—in the limits of a single passion.&nbsp; He could not—he would
      not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the
      peace of Vale Hall.&nbsp; I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,
      despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
      Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.&nbsp; I
      had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
      she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
      selfish.&nbsp; She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
      spoilt.&nbsp; She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
      when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
      but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
      ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she
      was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like
      me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.&nbsp; A
      very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the
      sisters of St. John.&nbsp; Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil
      Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a
      closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive
      adult acquaintance.
      She had taken an amiable caprice to me.&nbsp; She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
      only, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
      nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.”&nbsp; I was, however,
      good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.&nbsp; I was a lusus naturæ,
      she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous
      history, if known, would make a delightful romance.
      One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
      yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and
      the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French
      books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then
      my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a
      pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views
      from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.&nbsp;
      She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with
      delight.
      “Had I done these pictures?&nbsp; Did I know French and German?&nbsp; What a
      love—what a miracle I was!&nbsp; I drew better than her master in the first
      school in S-.&nbsp; Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”
      “With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
      idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.&nbsp; She had then on a
      dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
      was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
      wild grace of natural curls.&nbsp; I took a sheet of fine card-board, and
      drew a careful outline.&nbsp; I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it;
      and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit
      another day.
      She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
      accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
      grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
      flower near a hoary turret.&nbsp; He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
      personage; but he was very kind to me.&nbsp; The sketch of Rosamond’s
      portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of
      it.&nbsp; He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at
      Vale Hall.
      I went.&nbsp; I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
      evidences of wealth in the proprietor.&nbsp; Rosamond was full of glee and
      pleasure all the time I stayed.&nbsp; Her father was affable; and when he
      entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong
      terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he
      only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,
      and would soon quit it for one more suitable.
      “Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in a
      high family, papa.”
      I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in
      the land.&nbsp; Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with
      great respect.&nbsp; He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;
      that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once
      belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of that
      house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best.&nbsp; He accounted
      it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the
      design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable
      life away.&nbsp; It appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle
      in the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John.&nbsp; Mr. Oliver evidently
      regarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and sacred
      profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.
      It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.&nbsp; My little servant, after
      helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
      penny for her aid.&nbsp; All about me was spotless and bright—scoured floor,
      polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.&nbsp; I had also made myself neat,
      and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
      The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
      palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
      occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature.&nbsp; The head was
      finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery
      to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft
      curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the
      lash under the azured eyelid.&nbsp; I was absorbed in the execution of these
      nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St.
      John Rivers.
      “I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said.&nbsp; “Not, I
      hope, in thought?&nbsp; No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
      lonely.&nbsp; You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
      wonderfully so far.&nbsp; I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and
      he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine
      productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those
      days—the golden age of modern literature.&nbsp; Alas! the readers of our era
      are less favoured.&nbsp; But courage!&nbsp; I will not pause either to accuse or
      repine.&nbsp; I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon
      gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their
      existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.&nbsp;
      Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph,
      and feeble ones weep over their destruction.&nbsp; Poetry destroyed?&nbsp; Genius
      banished?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the
      thought.&nbsp; No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without
      their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell
      of your own meanness.
      While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of “Marmion” (for
      “Marmion” it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.&nbsp; His tall
      figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.&nbsp; I looked up at
      him: he shunned my eye.&nbsp; I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
      heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had
      then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to
      do him some good, if I could.
      “With all his firmness and self-control,” thought I, “he tasks himself
      too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses,
      imparts nothing.&nbsp; I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
      this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
      him talk.”
      I said first, “Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.”&nbsp; But he answered, as he always
      did, that he could not stay.&nbsp; “Very well,” I responded, mentally, “stand
      if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
      at least as bad for you as it is for me.&nbsp; I’ll try if I cannot discover
      the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that
      marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of
      sympathy.”
      “Is this portrait like?” I asked bluntly.
      “Like!&nbsp; Like whom?&nbsp; I did not observe it closely.”
      “You did, Mr. Rivers.”
      He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
      astonished.&nbsp; “Oh, that is nothing yet,” I muttered within.&nbsp; “I don’t
      mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I’m prepared to
      go to considerable lengths.”&nbsp; I continued, “You observed it closely and
      distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,” and I
      rose and placed it in his hand.
      “A well-executed picture,” he said; “very soft, clear colouring; very
      graceful and correct drawing.”
      “Yes, yes; I know all that.&nbsp; But what of the resemblance?&nbsp; Who is it
      like?”
      Mastering some hesitation, he answered, “Miss Oliver, I presume.”
      “Of course.&nbsp; And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
      promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
      picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.&nbsp; I
      don’t wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
      deem worthless.”
      He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
      held it, the more he seemed to covet it.&nbsp; “It is like!” he murmured;
      “the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.&nbsp;
      It smiles!”
      “Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?&nbsp;
      Tell me that.&nbsp; When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India,
      would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or
      would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and
      distress?”
      He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
      disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
      “That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
      or wise is another question.”
      Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
      father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my views
      than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
      their union.&nbsp; It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of
      Mr. Oliver’s large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he
      went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under
      a tropical sun.&nbsp; With this persuasion I now answered—
      “As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were
      to take to yourself the original at once.”
      By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table
      before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over
      it.&nbsp; I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.&nbsp; I
      saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
      unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt
      by him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief.&nbsp; Reserved people often
      really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more
      than the expansive.&nbsp; The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and
      to “burst” with boldness and good-will into “the silent sea” of their
      souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
      “She likes you, I am sure,” said I, as I stood behind his chair, “and
      her father respects you.&nbsp; Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather
      thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and
      her.&nbsp; You ought to marry her.”
      “Does she like me?” he asked.
      “Certainly; better than she likes any one else.&nbsp; She talks of you
      continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
      often.”
      “It is very pleasant to hear this,” he said—“very: go on for another
      quarter of an hour.”&nbsp; And he actually took out his watch and laid it
      upon the table to measure the time.
      “But where is the use of going on,” I asked, “when you are probably
      preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
      fetter your heart?”
      “Don’t imagine such hard things.&nbsp; Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
      doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
      overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
      with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
      intentions, of self-denying plans.&nbsp; And now it is deluged with a
      nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering them:
      now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale
      Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver’s feet: she is talking to me with her
      sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
      copied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips.&nbsp; She is mine—I am
      hers—this present life and passing world suffice to me.&nbsp; Hush! say
      nothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the time
      I marked pass in peace.”
      I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
      silent.&nbsp; Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
      the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
      “Now,” said he, “that little space was given to delirium and delusion.&nbsp;
      I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
      voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.&nbsp; I tasted her cup.&nbsp; The pillow
      was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter
      taste: her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all
      this.”
      I gazed at him in wonder.
      “It is strange,” pursued he, “that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
      wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
      which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience at
      the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me
      a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
      discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months’
      rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.&nbsp; This I know.”
      “Strange indeed!” I could not help ejaculating.
      “While something in me,” he went on, “is acutely sensible to her charms,
      something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
      that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate in nothing
      I undertook.&nbsp; Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?&nbsp;
      Rosamond a missionary’s wife?&nbsp; No!”
      “But you need not be a missionary.&nbsp; You might relinquish that scheme.”
      “Relinquish!&nbsp; What! my vocation?&nbsp; My great work?&nbsp; My foundation laid on
      earth for a mansion in heaven?&nbsp; My hopes of being numbered in the band
      who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
      race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting
      peace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of
      heaven for the fear of hell?&nbsp; Must I relinquish that?&nbsp; It is dearer than
      the blood in my veins.&nbsp; It is what I have to look forward to, and to
      live for.”
      After a considerable pause, I said—“And Miss Oliver?&nbsp; Are her
      disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?”
      “Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than
      a month, my image will be effaced from her heart.&nbsp; She will forget me;
      and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
      should do.”
      “You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.&nbsp; You are
      wasting away.”
      “No.&nbsp; If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
      unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated.&nbsp; Only this morning,
      I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
      long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
      yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.”
      “You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
      schoolroom.”
      Again the surprised expression crossed his face.&nbsp; He had not imagined
      that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.&nbsp; For me, I felt at home in
      this sort of discourse.&nbsp; I could never rest in communication with
      strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had
      passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold
      of confidence, and won a place by their heart’s very hearthstone.
      “You are original,” said he, “and not timid.&nbsp; There is something brave
      in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to
      assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.&nbsp; You think them
      more profound and potent than they are.&nbsp; You give me a larger allowance
      of sympathy than I have a just claim to.&nbsp; When I colour, and when I
      shade before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.&nbsp; I scorn the weakness.&nbsp;
      I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the
      convulsion of the soul.&nbsp; That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in
      the depths of a restless sea.&nbsp; Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man.”
      I smiled incredulously.
      “You have taken my confidence by storm,” he continued, “and now it is
      much at your service.&nbsp; I am simply, in my original state—stripped of
      that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human
      deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man.&nbsp; Natural affection only, of all
      the sentiments, has permanent power over me.&nbsp; Reason, and not feeling,
      is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do
      more than others, insatiable.&nbsp; I honour endurance, perseverance,
      industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great
      ends and mount to lofty eminence.&nbsp; I watch your career with interest,
      because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic
      woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or
      what you still suffer.”
      “You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,” I said.
      “No.&nbsp; There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
      believe; and I believe the Gospel.&nbsp; You missed your epithet.&nbsp; I am not a
      pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus.&nbsp; As
      His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.&nbsp; I
      advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.&nbsp; Won in youth to religion, she
      has cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ, natural
      affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.&nbsp; From
      the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense
      of the Divine justice.&nbsp; Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
      wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master’s
      kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.&nbsp; So much
      has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best
      account; pruning and training nature.&nbsp; But she could not eradicate
      nature: nor will it be eradicated ‘till this mortal shall put on
      immortality.’”
      Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
      palette.&nbsp; Once more he looked at the portrait.
      “She is lovely,” he murmured.&nbsp; “She is well named the Rose of the
      World, indeed!”
      “And may I not paint one like it for you?”
      “Cui bono?&nbsp; No.”
      He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
      accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
      being sullied.&nbsp; What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
      impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.&nbsp; He took it
      up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
      inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
      to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for
      it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.&nbsp; His lips parted, as if to
      speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
      “What is the matter?” I asked.
      “Nothing in the world,” was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
      him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.&nbsp; It disappeared in
      his glove; and, with one hasty nod and “good-afternoon,” he vanished.
      “Well!” I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, “that caps the
      globe, however!”
      I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
      dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.&nbsp; I
      pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
      being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
      forgot it.
