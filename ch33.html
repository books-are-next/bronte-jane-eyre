CHAPTER XXXI
My home, then, when I at last find a home,—is a cottage; a little room
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted
chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and
dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf.&nbsp; Above, a chamber of the same
dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers;
small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the
kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a
modest stock of such things as are necessary.
It is evening.&nbsp; I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.&nbsp; I am sitting alone on the hearth.&nbsp;
This morning, the village school opened.&nbsp; I had twenty scholars.&nbsp; But
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.&nbsp; Several knit, and a
few sew a little.&nbsp; They speak with the broadest accent of the district.&nbsp;
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other’s
language.&nbsp; Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
disposition that pleases me.&nbsp; I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
those of the best-born.&nbsp; My duty will be to develop these germs: surely
I shall find some happiness in discharging that office.&nbsp; Much enjoyment
I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless,
if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough
to live on from day to day.
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in
yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?&nbsp; Not to
deceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree.&nbsp; I
felt—yes, idiot that I am—I felt degraded.&nbsp; I doubted I had taken a step
which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.&nbsp; I
was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all
I heard and saw round me.&nbsp; But let me not hate and despise myself too
much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong—that is a great step
gained; I shall strive to overcome them.&nbsp; To-morrow, I trust, I shall
get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will
be quite subdued.&nbsp; In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of
seeing progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may
substitute gratification for disgust.
Meantime, let me ask myself one question—Which is better?—To have
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful
effort—no struggle;—but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen
asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst
the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
Rochester’s mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he
would—oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.&nbsp; He did love
me—no one will ever love me so again.&nbsp; I shall never more know the sweet
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else shall
I seem to possess these charms.&nbsp; He was fond and proud of me—it is what
no man besides will ever be.—But where am I wandering, and what am I
saying, and above all, feeling?&nbsp; Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
slave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss one
hour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
next—or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law,
and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.&nbsp; God
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the
guidance!
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a
mile from the village.&nbsp; The birds were singing their last strains—
“The air was mild, the dew was balm.”
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
ere long weeping—and why?&nbsp; For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now, perhaps, be
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
restoration thither.&nbsp; At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say lonely, for in
that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the
church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the
extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his
daughter lived.&nbsp; I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone
frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in
my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.&nbsp; A dog—old
Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing the gate
with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his
brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me.&nbsp; I asked
him to come in.
“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
left for you.&nbsp; I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.&nbsp; He examined my face, I
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
doubtless very visible upon it.
“Have you found your first day’s work harder than you expected?” he
asked.
“Oh, no!&nbsp; On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
scholars very well.”
“But perhaps your accommodations—your cottage—your furniture—have
disappointed your expectations?&nbsp; They are, in truth, scanty enough;
but—” I interrupted—
“My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
commodious.&nbsp; All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.&nbsp; I am not
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had
nothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance,
a home, a business.&nbsp; I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of
my friends; the bounty of my lot.&nbsp; I do not repine.”
“But you feel solitude an oppression?&nbsp; The little house there behind you
is dark and empty.”
“I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
to grow impatient under one of loneliness.”
“Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
vacillating fears of Lot’s wife.&nbsp; What you had left before I saw you, of
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every
temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present
career steadily, for some months at least.”
“It is what I mean to do,” I answered.&nbsp; St. John continued—
“It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the
bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.&nbsp; God
has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get—when our will
strains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
taste—and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
rougher than it.
“A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me
to death.&nbsp; I burnt for the more active life of the world—for the more
exciting toils of a literary career—for the destiny of an artist,
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
luster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice.&nbsp; I considered; my
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.&nbsp; After a season
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds—my powers
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
their wings, and mount beyond ken.&nbsp; God had an errand for me; to bear
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
“A missionary I resolved to be.&nbsp; From that moment my state of mind
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness—which time only can heal.&nbsp;
My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I
have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
broken through or cut asunder—a last conflict with human weakness, in
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I will
overcome—and I leave Europe for the East.”
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking,
when he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which
I looked too.&nbsp; Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up
the field to the wicket.&nbsp; We had heard no step on that grass-grown
track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the
hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a
silver bell, exclaimed—
“Good evening, Mr. Rivers.&nbsp; And good evening, old Carlo.&nbsp; Your dog is
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
your back towards me now.”
It was true.&nbsp; Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those
musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he
stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which
the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his face
directed towards the west.&nbsp; He turned at last, with measured
deliberation.&nbsp; A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.&nbsp;
There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a
youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after
bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long
veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.&nbsp; Perfect
beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as
sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure
hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies
generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.&nbsp; No charm
was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and
delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely
pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which
encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow
which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such
repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh,
and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the
even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the
ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which,
combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.&nbsp; I wondered, as
I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.&nbsp;
Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her
usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling,
with a grand-dame’s bounty.
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?&nbsp; I naturally asked
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.&nbsp; He
had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble
tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.
“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
“Oh, I only came home from S-” (she mentioned the name of a large town
some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon.&nbsp; Papa told me you had opened
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?”
pointing to me.
“It is,” said St. John.
“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct and
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
“I hope I shall.&nbsp; I have many inducements to do so.”
“Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?”
“Quite.”
“Do you like your house?”
“Very much.”
“Have I furnished it nicely?”
“Very nicely, indeed.”
“And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”
“You have indeed.&nbsp; She is teachable and handy.”&nbsp; (This then, I thought,
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of
fortune, as well as in those of nature!&nbsp; What happy combination of the
planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)
“I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” she added.&nbsp; “It will
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.&nbsp; Mr.
Rivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S-.&nbsp; Last night, or
rather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock.&nbsp; The ---th regiment
are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most
agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and
scissor merchants to shame.”
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper
lip curled a moment.&nbsp; His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
laughing girl gave him this information.&nbsp; He lifted his gaze, too, from
the daisies, and turned it on her.&nbsp; An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
gaze it was.&nbsp; She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.&nbsp; “Poor
Carlo loves me,” said she.&nbsp; “He is not stern and distant to his
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”
As she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his young
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face.&nbsp; I saw his
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.&nbsp;
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
for a woman.&nbsp; His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.&nbsp; But he curbed it, I
think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.&nbsp; He responded
neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver, looking
up.&nbsp; “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.&nbsp; He is alone this evening,
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”
“It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St.
John.
“Not a seasonable hour!&nbsp; But I declare it is.&nbsp; It is just the hour when
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no
business to occupy him.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Rivers, do come.&nbsp; Why are you so
very shy, and so very sombre?”&nbsp; She filled up the hiatus his silence
left by a reply of her own.
“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
shocked at herself.&nbsp; “I am so giddy and thoughtless!&nbsp; Do excuse me.&nbsp;
It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
joining in my chatter.&nbsp; Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
shut up, and you are so lonely.&nbsp; I am sure I pity you.&nbsp; Do come and see
papa.”
“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the
effort it cost him thus to refuse.
“Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay
any longer: the dew begins to fall.&nbsp; Good evening!”
She held out her hand.&nbsp; He just touched it.&nbsp; “Good evening!” he
repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo.&nbsp; She turned, but in a
moment returned.
“Are you well?” she asked.&nbsp; Well might she put the question: his face
was blanched as her gown.
“Quite well,” he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.&nbsp; She
went one way; he another.&nbsp; She turned twice to gaze after him as she
tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never
turned at all.
This spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts
from exclusive meditation on my own.&nbsp; Diana Rivers had designated her
brother “inexorable as death.”&nbsp; She had not exaggerated.

      “The air was mild, the dew was balm.”
      While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
      ere long weeping—and why?&nbsp; For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
      to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
      fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now, perhaps, be

      hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a
      silver bell, exclaimed—
      “Good evening, Mr. Rivers.&nbsp; And good evening, old Carlo.&nbsp; Your dog is
      quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
      and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
      your back towards me now.”
      It was true.&nbsp; Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those
      musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he
      stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which
      the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his face
      directed towards the west.&nbsp; He turned at last, with measured
      deliberation.&nbsp; A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.&nbsp;
      There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a
      youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after
      bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long
      veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty.&nbsp; Perfect
      beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as
      sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure
      hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies
      generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.&nbsp; No charm
      was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and
      delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely
      pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which
      encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow
      which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such
      repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh,
      and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the
      even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the
      ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which,
      combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.&nbsp; I wondered, as
      I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.&nbsp;
      Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her
      usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling,
      with a grand-dame’s bounty.
      What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?&nbsp; I naturally asked
      myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
      naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.&nbsp; He
      had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble
      tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.
      “A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he
      crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
      “Oh, I only came home from S-” (she mentioned the name of a large town
      some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon.&nbsp; Papa told me you had opened
      your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
      bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?”
      pointing to me.
      “It is,” said St. John.
      “Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct and
      naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
      “I hope I shall.&nbsp; I have many inducements to do so.”
      “Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?”
      “Quite.”
      “Do you like your house?”
      “Very much.”
      “Have I furnished it nicely?”
      “Very nicely, indeed.”
      “And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?”
      “You have indeed.&nbsp; She is teachable and handy.”&nbsp; (This then, I thought,
      is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of
      fortune, as well as in those of nature!&nbsp; What happy combination of the
      planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)
      “I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” she added.&nbsp; “It will
      be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.&nbsp; Mr.
      Rivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S-.&nbsp; Last night, or
      rather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock.&nbsp; The ---th regiment
      are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most
      agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and
      scissor merchants to shame.”
      It seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper
      lip curled a moment.&nbsp; His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
      and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
      laughing girl gave him this information.&nbsp; He lifted his gaze, too, from
      the daisies, and turned it on her.&nbsp; An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
      gaze it was.&nbsp; She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
      became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
      As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.&nbsp; “Poor
      Carlo loves me,” said she.&nbsp; “He is not stern and distant to his
      friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”
      As she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his young
      and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face.&nbsp; I saw his
      solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.&nbsp;
      Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
      for a woman.&nbsp; His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
      despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
      vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.&nbsp; But he curbed it, I
      think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.&nbsp; He responded
      neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
      “Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver, looking
      up.&nbsp; “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.&nbsp; He is alone this evening,
      and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”
      “It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St.
      John.
      “Not a seasonable hour!&nbsp; But I declare it is.&nbsp; It is just the hour when
      papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no
      business to occupy him.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Rivers, do come.&nbsp; Why are you so
      very shy, and so very sombre?”&nbsp; She filled up the hiatus his silence
      left by a reply of her own.
      “I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
      shocked at herself.&nbsp; “I am so giddy and thoughtless!&nbsp; Do excuse me.&nbsp;
      It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
      joining in my chatter.&nbsp; Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
      shut up, and you are so lonely.&nbsp; I am sure I pity you.&nbsp; Do come and see
      papa.”
      “Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”
      Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the
      effort it cost him thus to refuse.
      “Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay
      any longer: the dew begins to fall.&nbsp; Good evening!”
      She held out her hand.&nbsp; He just touched it.&nbsp; “Good evening!” he
      repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo.&nbsp; She turned, but in a
      moment returned.
      “Are you well?” she asked.&nbsp; Well might she put the question: his face
      was blanched as her gown.
      “Quite well,” he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.&nbsp; She
      went one way; he another.&nbsp; She turned twice to gaze after him as she
      tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never
      turned at all.
      This spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts
      from exclusive meditation on my own.&nbsp; Diana Rivers had designated her
      brother “inexorable as death.”&nbsp; She had not exaggerated.
