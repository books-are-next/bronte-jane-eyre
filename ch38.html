CHAPTER XXXVI
The daylight came.&nbsp; I rose at dawn.&nbsp; I busied myself for an hour or two
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.&nbsp;
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.&nbsp; He stopped at my door: I
feared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the
door.&nbsp; I took it up.&nbsp; It bore these words—
“You left me too suddenly last night.&nbsp; Had you stayed but a little
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the
angel’s crown.&nbsp; I shall expect your clear decision when I return this
day fortnight.&nbsp; Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into
temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is
weak.&nbsp; I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, St. John.”
“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and
my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,
when once that will is distinctly known to me.&nbsp; At any rate, it shall be
strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of
doubt, and find the open day of certainty.”
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
beat fast on my casement.&nbsp; I heard the front-door open, and St. John
pass out.&nbsp; Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.&nbsp;
He took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there
he would meet the coach.
“In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,” thought
I: “I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.&nbsp; I too have some to see and
ask after in England, before I depart for ever.”
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.&nbsp; I filled the interval in
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
given my plans their present bent.&nbsp; I recalled that inward sensation I
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
strangeness.&nbsp; I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned
whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in me—not in the
external world.&nbsp; I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion?&nbsp; I
could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.&nbsp; The
wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the
foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the
soul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,
whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a
cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit,
which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the
success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the
cumbrous body.
“Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated my musings, “I will know
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.&nbsp; Letters
have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them.”
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
and should be absent at least four days.
“Alone, Jane?” they asked.
“Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
time been uneasy.”
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had
often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained
from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough
to travel.&nbsp; I looked very pale, she observed.&nbsp; I replied, that nothing
ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
inquiries—no surmises.&nbsp; Having once explained to them that I could not
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
I left Moor House at three o’clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.&nbsp; Amidst the silence of those
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
distance.&nbsp; It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted
one summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and
objectless!&nbsp; It stopped as I beckoned.&nbsp; I entered—not now obliged to
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.&nbsp; Once more
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.&nbsp; I had set out from Whitcross
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the
midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral
hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern
North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
familiar face.&nbsp; Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
we were near my bourne.
“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.
“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”
“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself.&nbsp; I got out of the coach,
gave a box I had into the ostler’s charge, to be kept till I called for
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, “The
Rochester Arms.”&nbsp; My heart leapt up: I was already on my master’s very
lands.&nbsp; It fell again: the thought struck it:—
“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
who besides him is there?&nbsp; His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.&nbsp; You have lost
your labour—you had better go no farther,” urged the monitor.&nbsp; “Ask
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
they can solve your doubts at once.&nbsp; Go up to that man, and inquire if
Mr. Rochester be at home.”
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
it.&nbsp; I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.&nbsp; To prolong
doubt was to prolong hope.&nbsp; I might yet once more see the Hall under the
ray of her star.&nbsp; There was the stile before me—the very fields through
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of
them.&nbsp; How fast I walked!&nbsp; How I ran sometimes!&nbsp; How I looked forward to
catch the first view of the well-known woods!&nbsp; With what feelings I
welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill
between them!
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
the morning stillness.&nbsp; Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.&nbsp;
Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard
walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.&nbsp; “My
first view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single
out my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
front.&nbsp; Could I but see him!—but a moment!&nbsp; Surely, in that case, I
should not be so mad as to run to him?&nbsp; I cannot tell—I am not certain.&nbsp;
And if I did—what then?&nbsp; God bless him!&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Who would be hurt
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?&nbsp; I rave:
perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or
on the tideless sea of the south.”
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
pillars crowned by stone balls.&nbsp; From behind one pillar I could peep
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.&nbsp; I advanced my head with
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered
station were at my command.
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.&nbsp;
I wonder what they thought.&nbsp; They must have considered I was very
careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and
reckless.&nbsp; A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my
niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in
front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.&nbsp;
“What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have
demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”
Hear an illustration, reader.
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.&nbsp; He steals softly over the
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.&nbsp; All is still: he again
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of
beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest.&nbsp; How hurried was their
first glance!&nbsp; But how they fix!&nbsp; How he starts!&nbsp; How he suddenly and
vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,
touch with his finger!&nbsp; How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,
and gazes on it wildly!&nbsp; He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he
no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he
can make.&nbsp; He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone
dead.
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
ruin.
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!&nbsp; No need to listen for
doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!&nbsp; The
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.&nbsp; The
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no
roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
wild.&nbsp; No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never
received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church
aisle.&nbsp; The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had
fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled?&nbsp; What story belonged to this
disaster?&nbsp; What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had
followed upon it?&nbsp; Had life been wrecked as well as property?&nbsp; If so,
whose?&nbsp; Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even
dumb sign, mute token.
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
occurrence.&nbsp; Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void
arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.&nbsp; And oh!
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?&nbsp; In what land?&nbsp;
Under what auspices?&nbsp; My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church
tower near the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Rochester,
sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?”
Some answer must be had to these questions.&nbsp; I could find it nowhere but
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.&nbsp; The host himself brought
my breakfast into the parlour.&nbsp; I requested him to shut the door and sit
down: I had some questions to ask him.&nbsp; But when he complied, I scarcely
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.&nbsp; And yet
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
a tale of misery.&nbsp; The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
“You know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last.
“Yes, ma’am; I lived there once.”
“Did you?”&nbsp; Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
“I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added.
The late!&nbsp; I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
trying to evade.
“The late!” I gasped.&nbsp; “Is he dead?”
“I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained.&nbsp; I
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.&nbsp; Fully assured by these words
that Mr. Edward—my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he
was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman.”&nbsp;
Gladdening words!&nbsp; It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever
the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity.&nbsp; Since he was
not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
Antipodes.
“Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?” I asked, knowing, of
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
direct question as to where he really was.
“No, ma’am—oh, no!&nbsp; No one is living there.&nbsp; I suppose you are a
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
autumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
harvest-time.&nbsp; A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.&nbsp; The
fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from
Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.&nbsp; It was a terrible
spectacle: I witnessed it myself.”
“At dead of night!” I muttered.&nbsp; Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
at Thornfield.&nbsp; “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded.
“They guessed, ma’am: they guessed.&nbsp; Indeed, I should say it was
ascertained beyond a doubt.&nbsp; You are not perhaps aware,” he continued,
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that
there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”
“I have heard something of it.”
“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am: people even for some
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.&nbsp; No one saw her: they
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
she was it was difficult to conjecture.&nbsp; They said Mr. Edward had
brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.&nbsp;
But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”
I feared now to hear my own story.&nbsp; I endeavoured to recall him to the
main fact.
“And this lady?”
“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s
wife!&nbsp; The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.&nbsp; There was
a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”
“But the fire,” I suggested.
“I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with.&nbsp; The
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
after her continually.&nbsp; They used to watch him—servants will, you know,
ma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
thought her so very handsome.&nbsp; She was a little small thing, they say,
almost like a child.&nbsp; I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the
house-maid, tell of her.&nbsp; Leah liked her well enough.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
bewitched.&nbsp; Well, he would marry her.”
“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but
now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.&nbsp;
Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?”
“You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody
but her, that set it going.&nbsp; She had a woman to take care of her called
Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—she kept a
private bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over-much.&nbsp;
It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was
dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,
the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of
her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the
house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.&nbsp; They say she
had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about
that.&nbsp; However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the
room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her
way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as if she
knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)—and she
kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it,
fortunately.&nbsp; The governess had run away two months before; and for all
Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he
had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew
savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but
he got dangerous after he lost her.&nbsp; He would be alone, too.&nbsp; He sent
Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he
did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
deserved it—she was a very good woman.&nbsp; Miss Adèle, a ward he had, was
put to school.&nbsp; He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
himself up like a hermit at the Hall.”
“What! did he not leave England?”
“Leave England?&nbsp; Bless you, no!&nbsp; He would not cross the door-stones of
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he
was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am.&nbsp;
He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he
was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if
ever man had.&nbsp; I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have
often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
Thornfield Hall.”
“Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”
“Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.&nbsp; And
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own
eyes.&nbsp; She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it
streaming against the flames as she stood.&nbsp; I witnessed, and several
more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the
roof; we heard him call ‘Bertha!’&nbsp; We saw him approach her; and then,
ma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed
on the pavement.”
“Dead?”
“Dead!&nbsp; Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
scattered.”
“Good God!”
“You may well say so, ma’am: it was frightful!”
He shuddered.
“And afterwards?” I urged.
“Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
only some bits of walls standing now.”
“Were any other lives lost?”
“No—perhaps it would have been better if there had.”
“What do you mean?”
“Poor Mr. Edward!” he ejaculated, “I little thought ever to have seen
it!&nbsp; Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first
marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one
living: but I pity him, for my part.”
“You said he was alive?” I exclaimed.
“Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.”
“Why?&nbsp; How?”&nbsp; My blood was again running cold.&nbsp; “Where is he?” I
demanded.&nbsp; “Is he in England?”
“Ay—ay—he’s in England; he can’t get out of England, I fancy—he’s a
fixture now.”
What agony was this!&nbsp; And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
“He is stone-blind,” he said at last.&nbsp; “Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
Edward.”
I had dreaded worse.&nbsp; I had dreaded he was mad.&nbsp; I summoned strength to
ask what had caused this calamity.
“It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
ma’am: he wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out before
him.&nbsp; As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash—all
fell.&nbsp; He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had
to amputate it directly.&nbsp; The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of
that also.&nbsp; He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a cripple.”
“Where is he?&nbsp; Where does he now live?”
“At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
quite a desolate spot.”
“Who is with him?”
“Old John and his wife: he would have none else.&nbsp; He is quite broken
down, they say.”
“Have you any sort of conveyance?”
“We have a chaise, ma’am, a very handsome chaise.”
“Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
Ferndean before dark this day, I’ll pay both you and him twice the hire
you usually demand.”

      on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
      It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.&nbsp; I had set out from Whitcross
      on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
      coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the

      “Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”

      information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
      they can solve your doubts at once.&nbsp; Go up to that man, and inquire if
      Mr. Rochester be at home.”
      The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
      it.&nbsp; I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.&nbsp; To prolong
      doubt was to prolong hope.&nbsp; I might yet once more see the Hall under the
      ray of her star.&nbsp; There was the stile before me—the very fields through
      which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
      tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
      well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of
      them.&nbsp; How fast I walked!&nbsp; How I ran sometimes!&nbsp; How I looked forward to
      catch the first view of the well-known woods!&nbsp; With what feelings I
      welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill
      between them!
      At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
      the morning stillness.&nbsp; Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.&nbsp;
      Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard
      walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.&nbsp; “My
      first view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold
      battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single
      out my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises
      early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
      front.&nbsp; Could I but see him!—but a moment!&nbsp; Surely, in that case, I
      should not be so mad as to run to him?&nbsp; I cannot tell—I am not certain.&nbsp;
      And if I did—what then?&nbsp; God bless him!&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Who would be hurt
      by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?&nbsp; I rave:
      perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or
      on the tideless sea of the south.”
      I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:
      there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
      pillars crowned by stone balls.&nbsp; From behind one pillar I could peep
      round quietly at the full front of the mansion.&nbsp; I advanced my head with
      precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
      drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered
      station were at my command.
      The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.&nbsp;
      I wonder what they thought.&nbsp; They must have considered I was very
      careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and
      reckless.&nbsp; A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my
      niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in
      front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.&nbsp;
      “What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have
      demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”
      Hear an illustration, reader.
      A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
      glimpse of her fair face without waking her.&nbsp; He steals softly over the
      grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he
      withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.&nbsp; All is still: he again
      advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
      lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of
      beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest.&nbsp; How hurried was their
      first glance!&nbsp; But how they fix!&nbsp; How he starts!&nbsp; How he suddenly and
      vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,
      touch with his finger!&nbsp; How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,
      and gazes on it wildly!&nbsp; He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he
      no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he
      can make.&nbsp; He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone
      dead.
      I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
      ruin.
      No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber
      lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!&nbsp; No need to listen for
      doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!&nbsp; The
      lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.&nbsp; The
      front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
      high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no
      roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.
      And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
      wild.&nbsp; No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never
      received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church
      aisle.&nbsp; The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had
      fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled?&nbsp; What story belonged to this
      disaster?&nbsp; What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had
      followed upon it?&nbsp; Had life been wrecked as well as property?&nbsp; If so,
      whose?&nbsp; Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even
      dumb sign, mute token.
      In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
      interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
      occurrence.&nbsp; Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void
      arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
      drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
      weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.&nbsp; And oh!
      where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?&nbsp; In what land?&nbsp;
      Under what auspices?&nbsp; My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church
      tower near the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Rochester,
      sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?”
      Some answer must be had to these questions.&nbsp; I could find it nowhere but
      at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.&nbsp; The host himself brought
      my breakfast into the parlour.&nbsp; I requested him to shut the door and sit
      down: I had some questions to ask him.&nbsp; But when he complied, I scarcely
      knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.&nbsp; And yet
      the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
      a tale of misery.&nbsp; The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
      “You know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last.
      “Yes, ma’am; I lived there once.”
      “Did you?”&nbsp; Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
      “I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added.
      The late!&nbsp; I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
      trying to evade.
      “The late!” I gasped.&nbsp; “Is he dead?”
      “I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained.&nbsp; I
      breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.&nbsp; Fully assured by these words
      that Mr. Edward—my Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he
      was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman.”&nbsp;
      Gladdening words!&nbsp; It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever
      the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity.&nbsp; Since he was
      not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
      Antipodes.
      “Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?” I asked, knowing, of
      course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
      direct question as to where he really was.
      “No, ma’am—oh, no!&nbsp; No one is living there.&nbsp; I suppose you are a
      stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
      autumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
      harvest-time.&nbsp; A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
      property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.&nbsp; The
      fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from
      Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.&nbsp; It was a terrible
      spectacle: I witnessed it myself.”
      “At dead of night!” I muttered.&nbsp; Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
      at Thornfield.&nbsp; “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded.
      “They guessed, ma’am: they guessed.&nbsp; Indeed, I should say it was
      ascertained beyond a doubt.&nbsp; You are not perhaps aware,” he continued,
      edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that
      there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”
      “I have heard something of it.”
      “She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am: people even for some
      years was not absolutely certain of her existence.&nbsp; No one saw her: they
      only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
      she was it was difficult to conjecture.&nbsp; They said Mr. Edward had
      brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.&nbsp;
      But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”
      I feared now to hear my own story.&nbsp; I endeavoured to recall him to the
      main fact.
      “And this lady?”
      “This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s
      wife!&nbsp; The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.&nbsp; There was
      a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”
      “But the fire,” I suggested.
      “I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with.&nbsp; The
      servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
      after her continually.&nbsp; They used to watch him—servants will, you know,
      ma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
      thought her so very handsome.&nbsp; She was a little small thing, they say,
      almost like a child.&nbsp; I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the
      house-maid, tell of her.&nbsp; Leah liked her well enough.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was
      about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
      of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
      bewitched.&nbsp; Well, he would marry her.”
      “You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but
      now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.&nbsp;
      Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?”
      “You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody
      but her, that set it going.&nbsp; She had a woman to take care of her called
      Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
      fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—she kept a
      private bottle of gin by her, and now and then took a drop over-much.&nbsp;
      It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was
      dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,
      the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of
      her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the
      house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.&nbsp; They say she
      had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about
      that.&nbsp; However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the
      room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her
      way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as if she
      knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)—and she
      kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it,
      fortunately.&nbsp; The governess had run away two months before; and for all
      Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he
      had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew
      savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but
      he got dangerous after he lost her.&nbsp; He would be alone, too.&nbsp; He sent
      Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he
      did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
      deserved it—she was a very good woman.&nbsp; Miss Adèle, a ward he had, was
      put to school.&nbsp; He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
      himself up like a hermit at the Hall.”
      “What! did he not leave England?”
      “Leave England?&nbsp; Bless you, no!&nbsp; He would not cross the door-stones of
      the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
      grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my
      opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he
      was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am.&nbsp;
      He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he
      was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if
      ever man had.&nbsp; I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have
      often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
      Thornfield Hall.”
      “Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”
      “Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
      above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
      down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.&nbsp; And
      then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
      standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
      they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own
      eyes.&nbsp; She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it
      streaming against the flames as she stood.&nbsp; I witnessed, and several
      more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the
      roof; we heard him call ‘Bertha!’&nbsp; We saw him approach her; and then,
      ma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed
      on the pavement.”
      “Dead?”
      “Dead!&nbsp; Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
      scattered.”
      “Good God!”
      “You may well say so, ma’am: it was frightful!”
      He shuddered.
      “And afterwards?” I urged.
      “Well, ma’am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
      only some bits of walls standing now.”
      “Were any other lives lost?”
      “No—perhaps it would have been better if there had.”
      “What do you mean?”
      “Poor Mr. Edward!” he ejaculated, “I little thought ever to have seen
      it!&nbsp; Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first
      marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one
      living: but I pity him, for my part.”
      “You said he was alive?” I exclaimed.
      “Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.”
      “Why?&nbsp; How?”&nbsp; My blood was again running cold.&nbsp; “Where is he?” I
      demanded.&nbsp; “Is he in England?”
      “Ay—ay—he’s in England; he can’t get out of England, I fancy—he’s a
      fixture now.”
      What agony was this!&nbsp; And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
      “He is stone-blind,” he said at last.&nbsp; “Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
      Edward.”
      I had dreaded worse.&nbsp; I had dreaded he was mad.&nbsp; I summoned strength to
      ask what had caused this calamity.
      “It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
      ma’am: he wouldn’t leave the house till every one else was out before
      him.&nbsp; As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
      had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash—all
      fell.&nbsp; He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
      beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
      knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had
      to amputate it directly.&nbsp; The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of
      that also.&nbsp; He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a cripple.”
      “Where is he?&nbsp; Where does he now live?”
      “At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
      quite a desolate spot.”
      “Who is with him?”
      “Old John and his wife: he would have none else.&nbsp; He is quite broken
      down, they say.”
      “Have you any sort of conveyance?”
      “We have a chaise, ma’am, a very handsome chaise.”
      “Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
      Ferndean before dark this day, I’ll pay both you and him twice the hire
      you usually demand.”
