CHAPTER XVI
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
meet his eye.&nbsp; During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had
the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
quiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax’s
voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and even John’s
own gruff tones.&nbsp; There were exclamations of “What a mercy master was
not burnt in his bed!”&nbsp; “It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
night.”&nbsp; “How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
water-jug!”&nbsp; “I wonder he waked nobody!”&nbsp; “It is to be hoped he will not
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &amp;c.
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order;
only the bed was stripped of its hangings.&nbsp; Leah stood up in the
window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.&nbsp; I was about
to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the
affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman
sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.&nbsp;
That woman was no other than Grace Poole.
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.&nbsp; She was intent on
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.&nbsp; I was
amazed—confounded.&nbsp; She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
guilt, or fear of detection.&nbsp; She said “Good morning, Miss,” in her
usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more
tape, went on with her sewing.
“I will put her to some test,” thought I: “such absolute impenetrability
is past comprehension.”
“Good morning, Grace,” I said.&nbsp; “Has anything happened here?&nbsp; I thought
I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.”
“Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
the flames with the water in the ewer.”
“A strange affair!” I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
fixedly—“Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?&nbsp; Did no one hear him move?”
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
consciousness in their expression.&nbsp; She seemed to examine me warily;
then she answered—
“The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
to hear.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to master’s; but
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
sleep heavy.”&nbsp; She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone—“But you are
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have
heard a noise?”
“I did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still
polishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was
Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a
strange one.”
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—
“It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.”
“I was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
provoked me.&nbsp; Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
conscious eye.
“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired.
“I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.”
“You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
gallery?” she further asked.
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
information unawares.&nbsp; The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.”
“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
you get into bed?”
“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
accordingly!”&nbsp; Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
sharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
think it necessary.&nbsp; I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on
the words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture
to lie down.”
“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’ worth
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.&nbsp; And you see, for such a
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door
is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and
any mischief that may be about.&nbsp; A deal of people, Miss, are for
trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with
the means, though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.”&nbsp;
And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with
the demureness of a Quakeress.
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
entered.
“Mrs. Poole,” said she, addressing Grace, “the servants’ dinner will
soon be ready: will you come down?”
“No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I’ll
carry it upstairs.”
“You’ll have some meat?”
“Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.”
“And the sago?”
“Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I’ll
make it myself.”
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
so I departed.
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration
during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the
enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the
problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not
been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed
from her master’s service.&nbsp; He had almost as much as declared his
conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld
him from accusing her?&nbsp; Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?&nbsp; It was
strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the
power of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power,
that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly
charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
not be admitted.&nbsp; “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once; her
youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me
once, she had lived here many years.&nbsp; I don’t think she can ever have
been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and
strength of character to compensate for the want of personal
advantages.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:
Grace is eccentric at least.&nbsp; What if a former caprice (a freak very
possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him
into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret
influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake
off, and dare not disregard?”&nbsp; But, having reached this point of
conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even
coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought,
“No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct.&nbsp; Yet,” suggested the
secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “you are not beautiful
either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have
often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words; remember his
look; remember his voice!”
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
vividly renewed.&nbsp; I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent
over her and directed her pencil.&nbsp; She looked up with a sort of start.
“Qu’ avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she.&nbsp; “Vos doigts tremblent comme la
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”
“I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!”&nbsp; She went on sketching; I went on
thinking.
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been
conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.&nbsp; I compared myself
with her, and found we were different.&nbsp; Bessie Leaven had said I was
quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady.&nbsp; And now I looked much
better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,
more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener
enjoyments.
“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window.&nbsp; “I have
never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but
surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the
morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled
that it is grown impatient.”
When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.&nbsp; I listened for the
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to the
door, expecting it to open and admit him.&nbsp; The door remained shut;
darkness only came in through the window.&nbsp; Still it was not late; he
often sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six.&nbsp;
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
things to say to him!&nbsp; I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
he really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous attempt;
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.&nbsp; It little mattered
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try
my skill.&nbsp; Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
restraint; this suited both him and me.
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.&nbsp; Leah made her appearance; but it
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.&nbsp; Thither
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.
“You must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you ate
so little at dinner.&nbsp; I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well
to-day: you look flushed and feverish.”
“Oh, quite well!&nbsp; I never felt better.”
“Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
teapot while I knit off this needle?”&nbsp; Having completed her task, she
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
deepening into total obscurity.
“It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes,
“though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable
day for his journey.”
“Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?&nbsp; I did not know he was out.”
“Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!&nbsp; He is gone to the Leas,
Mr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.&nbsp; I believe
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
Colonel Dent, and others.”
“Do you expect him back to-night?”
“No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.&nbsp; Gentlemen
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and
good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.”
“Are there ladies at the Leas?”
“There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.&nbsp; She came here to a
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.&nbsp; You should have seen the
dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
up!&nbsp; I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
the evening.”
“You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?”
“Yes, I saw her.&nbsp; The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
hear some of the ladies sing and play.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester would have me to
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.&nbsp; I never saw
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
was certainly the queen.”
“And what was she like?”
“Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
Rochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.&nbsp; And then
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly
arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the
glossiest curls I ever saw.&nbsp; She was dressed in pure white; an
amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast,
tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.&nbsp;
She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well
with the jetty mass of her curls.”
“She was greatly admired, of course?”
“Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.&nbsp;
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
piano.&nbsp; She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”
“Mr. Rochester?&nbsp; I was not aware he could sing.”
“Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”
“And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?”
“A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
listen to her;—and she played afterwards.&nbsp; I am no judge of music, but
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably
good.”
“And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?”
“It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
fortunes.&nbsp; Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly entailed, and the
eldest son came in for everything almost.”
“But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
Mr. Rochester, for instance.&nbsp; He is rich, is he not?”
“Oh! yes.&nbsp; But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”
“What of that?&nbsp; More unequal matches are made every day.”
“True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
of the sort.&nbsp; But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
began tea.”
“No: I am too thirsty to eat.&nbsp; Will you let me have another cup?”
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the
conversation was turned into another channel.
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the general
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past;
Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain,
unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly
devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of
life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet
lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
“You,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester?&nbsp; You gifted with
the power of pleasing him?&nbsp; You of importance to him in any way?&nbsp; Go!
your folly sickens me.&nbsp; And you have derived pleasure from occasional
tokens of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and
a man of the world to a dependent and a novice.&nbsp; How dared you?&nbsp; Poor
stupid dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated
to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face
and be ashamed!&nbsp; He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?&nbsp;
Blind puppy!&nbsp; Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
senselessness!&nbsp; It does good to no woman to be flattered by her
superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in
all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned
and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
responded to, must lead, ignis-fatus-like, into miry wilds whence
there is no extrication.
“Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
irregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
poor, and plain.’
“Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;—What! you
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!&nbsp; Order!&nbsp; No snivel!—no sentiment!—no
regret!&nbsp; I will endure only sense and resolution.&nbsp; Recall the august yet
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond
ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aërial lace and
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it ‘Blanche, an
accomplished lady of rank.’
“Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, ‘Mr.
Rochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
indigent and insignificant plebeian?’”
“I’ll do it,” I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
calm, and fell asleep.
I kept my word.&nbsp; An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.&nbsp; It looked a lovely face enough, and
when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as
self-control could desire.&nbsp; I derived benefit from the task: it had kept
my head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.&nbsp; Thanks to
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
maintain, even externally.

      “Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I’ll
      make it myself.”
      The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
      so I departed.
      I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration
      during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the
      enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the
      problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not
      been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed
      from her master’s service.&nbsp; He had almost as much as declared his
      conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld
      him from accusing her?&nbsp; Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?&nbsp; It was
      strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the
      power of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power,
      that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly
      charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.
      Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
      that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
      her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
      not be admitted.&nbsp; “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once; her
      youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me
      once, she had lived here many years.&nbsp; I don’t think she can ever have
      been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and
      strength of character to compensate for the want of personal
      advantages.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:
      Grace is eccentric at least.&nbsp; What if a former caprice (a freak very
      possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him
      into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret
      influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake
      off, and dare not disregard?”&nbsp; But, having reached this point of
      conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even
      coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought,
      “No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct.&nbsp; Yet,” suggested the
      secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “you are not beautiful
      either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have
      often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words; remember his
      look; remember his voice!”
      I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
      vividly renewed.&nbsp; I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent
      over her and directed her pencil.&nbsp; She looked up with a sort of start.
      “Qu’ avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she.&nbsp; “Vos doigts tremblent comme la
      feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”
      “I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!”&nbsp; She went on sketching; I went on
      thinking.
      I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been
      conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.&nbsp; I compared myself
      with her, and found we were different.&nbsp; Bessie Leaven had said I was
      quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady.&nbsp; And now I looked much
      better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,
      more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener
      enjoyments.
      “Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window.&nbsp; “I have
      never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but
      surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the
      morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled
      that it is grown impatient.”
      When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the
      nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.&nbsp; I listened for the
      bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
      fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to the
      door, expecting it to open and admit him.&nbsp; The door remained shut;
      darkness only came in through the window.&nbsp; Still it was not late; he
      often sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six.&nbsp;
      Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
      things to say to him!&nbsp; I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
      Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
      he really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous attempt;
      and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.&nbsp; It little mattered
      whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
      soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
      instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
      provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try
      my skill.&nbsp; Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
      station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
      restraint; this suited both him and me.
      A tread creaked on the stairs at last.&nbsp; Leah made her appearance; but it
      was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room.&nbsp; Thither
      I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
      imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.
      “You must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you ate
      so little at dinner.&nbsp; I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well
      to-day: you look flushed and feverish.”
      “Oh, quite well!&nbsp; I never felt better.”
      “Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
      teapot while I knit off this needle?”&nbsp; Having completed her task, she
      rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
      suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
      deepening into total obscurity.
      “It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes,
      “though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable
      day for his journey.”
      “Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?&nbsp; I did not know he was out.”
      “Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!&nbsp; He is gone to the Leas,
      Mr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.&nbsp; I believe
      there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
      Colonel Dent, and others.”
      “Do you expect him back to-night?”
      “No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
      week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
      so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
      please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.&nbsp; Gentlemen
      especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
      so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
      favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
      his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
      but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and
      good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.”
      “Are there ladies at the Leas?”
      “There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies
      indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
      beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
      years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.&nbsp; She came here to a
      Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.&nbsp; You should have seen the
      dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
      up!&nbsp; I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of
      the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
      the evening.”
      “You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?”
      “Yes, I saw her.&nbsp; The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
      Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
      hear some of the ladies sing and play.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester would have me to
      come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.&nbsp; I never saw
      a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
      them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
      was certainly the queen.”
      “And what was she like?”
      “Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
      complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
      Rochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.&nbsp; And then
      she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly
      arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the
      glossiest curls I ever saw.&nbsp; She was dressed in pure white; an
      amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast,
      tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.&nbsp;
      She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well
      with the jetty mass of her curls.”
      “She was greatly admired, of course?”
      “Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.&nbsp;
      She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
      piano.&nbsp; She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”
      “Mr. Rochester?&nbsp; I was not aware he could sing.”
      “Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”
      “And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?”
      “A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
      listen to her;—and she played afterwards.&nbsp; I am no judge of music, but
      Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably
      good.”
      “And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?”
      “It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
      fortunes.&nbsp; Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly entailed, and the
      eldest son came in for everything almost.”
      “But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
      Mr. Rochester, for instance.&nbsp; He is rich, is he not?”
      “Oh! yes.&nbsp; But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
      Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”
      “What of that?&nbsp; More unequal matches are made every day.”
      “True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
      of the sort.&nbsp; But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
      began tea.”
      “No: I am too thirsty to eat.&nbsp; Will you let me have another cup?”
      I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
      Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the
      conversation was turned into another channel.
      When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
      my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
      back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s
      boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
      Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
      wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the general
      state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past;
      Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain,
      unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly
      devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—
      That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of
      life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet
      lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
      “You,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester?&nbsp; You gifted with
      the power of pleasing him?&nbsp; You of importance to him in any way?&nbsp; Go!
      your folly sickens me.&nbsp; And you have derived pleasure from occasional
      tokens of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and
      a man of the world to a dependent and a novice.&nbsp; How dared you?&nbsp; Poor
      stupid dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated
      to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face
      and be ashamed!&nbsp; He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?&nbsp;
      Blind puppy!&nbsp; Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
      senselessness!&nbsp; It does good to no woman to be flattered by her
      superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in
      all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned
      and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
      responded to, must lead, ignis-fatus-like, into miry wilds whence
      there is no extrication.
      “Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
      before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
      softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
      irregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
      poor, and plain.’
      “Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your
      drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
      tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
      the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
      sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
      Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;—What! you
      revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!&nbsp; Order!&nbsp; No snivel!—no sentiment!—no
      regret!&nbsp; I will endure only sense and resolution.&nbsp; Recall the august yet
      harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
      dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond
      ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aërial lace and
      glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it ‘Blanche, an
      accomplished lady of rank.’
      “Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
      well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, ‘Mr.
      Rochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to
      strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
      indigent and insignificant plebeian?’”
      “I’ll do it,” I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
      calm, and fell asleep.
      I kept my word.&nbsp; An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
      crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
      of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.&nbsp; It looked a lovely face enough, and
      when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as
      self-control could desire.&nbsp; I derived benefit from the task: it had kept
      my head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
      impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
      Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
      discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.&nbsp; Thanks to
      it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
      had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
      maintain, even externally.

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="69">expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="11" data-nb-chars="53">the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="69">own gruff tones.&nbsp; There were exclamations of “What a mercy master was</span>

            <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="68">sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.</span>
